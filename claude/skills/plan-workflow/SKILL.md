  relays user feedback, and verifies the final plan. Use when the user wants to plan
  a feature, investigate a ticket, design an approach, create a PLAN.md, scope work,
  or says things like "plan this", "how should we approach", "let's think through",
  "create a plan for", or references a Linear ticket they want planned. Also use when
  task-workflow needs a plan that doesn't exist yet. This is NOT a skill for Claude
  to plan alone — Codex does the deep reasoning; Claude orchestrates.

# Plan Workflow

Orchestrate Codex (the Wizard) to produce a PLAN.md. You are the Paladin — your role
is context-gathering, dispatch, verification, and relay. Codex does the deep research
and plan authoring.

## Phase 1 — Gather Context

Before dispatching Codex, assemble everything the Wizard needs to reason well.

1. **Understand the ask** — What does the user want planned? A Linear ticket, a feature
   idea, a bug investigation, an architectural change? Extract the goal and constraints.
2. **Fetch external context** — If the user references a Linear ticket, fetch it via MCP.
   If they mention a Notion doc, fetch that. Gather all external inputs first.
3. **Read relevant code** — Identify the files, modules, or areas of the codebase that
   the plan will touch. Read them. Codex can read files too, but pre-loading key context
   into the prompt reduces Codex's search time and improves plan quality.
4. **Check for existing plans** — Look for `PLAN.md` or `plans/*.md` in the repo. If a
   plan already exists for this work, the user may want iteration rather than creation.
5. **Identify constraints** — Deadlines, dependencies, blocked-by items, scope limits.
   These go into the Codex prompt so the plan accounts for them.

**Output of Phase 1:** A mental model of the work plus all context needed for the prompt.
Do NOT write a plan yourself. Proceed to dispatch.

## Phase 2 — Dispatch to Codex

Compose a rich prompt and send it to Codex via `--prompt`. The prompt quality directly
determines plan quality — invest here.

### Prompt Construction

Write the prompt to a temp file (prompts with quotes and backticks break inline shell):

```bash
cat > /tmp/codex-plan-prompt.md << 'PROMPT_EOF'
## Task
Create a PLAN.md for: <goal description>

## Context
<paste or summarize the gathered context: ticket details, relevant code excerpts,
existing architecture, constraints, user preferences>

## Requirements
- The plan must be actionable — each step should be implementable via task-workflow
- Include scope boundaries (In Scope / Out of Scope)
- Break work into discrete, ordered tasks with checkboxes (`- [ ]`)
- Identify risks, dependencies, and open questions
- Suggest a branch naming convention if multiple PRs are expected
- Keep it concise — a plan is a map, not a novel

## Output
Write the plan to: <plan_path>
Use standard PLAN.md format with sections: Goal, Context, Scope, Tasks, Risks, Open Questions.
PROMPT_EOF

~/.claude/skills/codex-transport/scripts/tmux-codex.sh \
  --prompt "$(cat /tmp/codex-plan-prompt.md)" <work_dir>
```

### Choosing the Right Mode

| Situation | Mode | Why |
|-----------|------|-----|
| New plan from scratch | `--prompt` | Codex creates the plan file and writes it |
| Review an existing plan | `--plan-review` | Uses the review template, returns TOON findings |
| Iterate on Codex's draft | `--prompt` | Send feedback, ask for revisions |

`--plan-review` is for evaluating a plan that already exists as a file. For initial
creation, use `--prompt` with explicit instructions to write the plan file.

### While Codex Works

Codex dispatch is non-blocking. You are NOT idle:

- **Verify file paths** mentioned in your context-gathering — do they still exist?
- **Prepare follow-up context** — if the user mentioned related work, gather that too
- **Draft verification questions** — what should you check when the plan arrives?

Do NOT poll Codex. Wait for the `[CODEX]` notification.

## Phase 3 — Receive and Verify

When `[CODEX] Task complete. Response at: <path>` arrives:

1. **Read the plan** — Use your Read tool on the plan file Codex wrote
2. **Verify completeness:**
   - Does it cover all requirements from the user's ask?
   - Are file paths real? (`Glob` or `Grep` to confirm)
   - Are scope boundaries clear (In Scope / Out of Scope)?
   - Are tasks ordered correctly (dependencies respected)?
   - Is the scope reasonable — not too ambitious, not too narrow?
3. **Cross-check against code** — If the plan references specific functions, classes,
   or APIs, verify they exist and behave as the plan assumes
4. **Flag concerns** — Note anything questionable but do NOT silently fix the plan.
   Your concerns go to the user, not into the file.

## Phase 4 — Present to User

Present the plan with your verification notes:

1. **Show the plan** — Summarize key sections, or show in full if short
2. **Highlight your concerns** — If file paths were wrong, scope seems off, or tasks
   are missing, say so clearly
3. **Invite feedback** — Ask the user if they want changes, have questions, or approve

Keep your presentation concise. The plan speaks for itself — add only what the user
needs to make a decision.

## Phase 5 — Iterate

If the user has feedback, relay it to Codex:

```bash
cat > /tmp/codex-plan-revision.md << 'PROMPT_EOF'
## Plan Revision Request

The user reviewed the plan at <plan_path> and has feedback:

<user's feedback, verbatim or faithfully paraphrased>

## Instructions
- Read the current plan at <plan_path>
- Apply the requested changes
- Write the updated plan to the same path (overwrite)
- Preserve parts the user didn't comment on
PROMPT_EOF

~/.claude/skills/codex-transport/scripts/tmux-codex.sh \
  --prompt "$(cat /tmp/codex-plan-revision.md)" <work_dir>
```

Repeat Phase 3–5 until the user approves.

**Add your own concerns too.** If you spotted issues in Phase 3, include them in the
revision prompt alongside the user's feedback. You are a reviewer, not just a relay.

## Phase 6 — Finalize

Once the user approves:

1. **Confirm plan location** — Ensure the plan is at the expected path (typically
   `PLAN.md` in the repo root, or `plans/<feature>.md` for multi-plan repos)
2. **Dispatch plan review** — If the plan is substantial, optionally send for formal
   review:
   ```bash
   ~/.claude/skills/codex-transport/scripts/tmux-codex.sh \
     --plan-review "<plan_path>" <work_dir>
   ```
   This returns TOON findings on architecture, feasibility, and risk. Present any
   blocking findings to the user before proceeding.
3. **Signal readiness** — Tell the user the plan is ready for execution. If appropriate,
   suggest: "Shall I begin with `/task-workflow`?"

## Quick Reference

| Phase | Paladin's Job | Codex's Job |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| Gather | Read code, fetch tickets, assemble context | — |
| Dispatch | Compose prompt, send via tmux-codex.sh | Research, reason, write PLAN.md |
| Verify | Check paths, scope, completeness | — |
| Present | Summarize plan, flag concerns | — |
| Iterate | Relay feedback + own concerns | Revise plan |
| Finalize | Confirm location, optional plan-review | Review (if requested) |

## Anti-Patterns

- **Writing the plan yourself** — You are the Paladin, not the Wizard. Dispatch to Codex.
- **Thin prompts** — "Make a plan for X" wastes Codex's cycles. Rich context = better plans.
- **Silent corrections** — If the plan has issues, tell the user. Don't edit Codex's output.
- **Skipping verification** — File paths in plans go stale. Always verify against the codebase.
- **Polling Codex** — The dispatch is non-blocking. Work on verification prep, not `sleep`.

## Integration with Other Workflows

- **task-workflow** expects a PLAN.md with checkboxes. Plans from this skill are designed
  to feed directly into task-workflow execution.
- **party-dispatch** can parallelize tasks from the plan across worker sessions.
- **bugfix-workflow** may invoke this skill when investigation reveals the fix needs planning.
