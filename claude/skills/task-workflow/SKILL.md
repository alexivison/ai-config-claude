# Task Workflow

Execute tasks from TASK*.md files with the full autonomous workflow.

## Pre-Implementation Gate

**STOP. Before writing ANY code:**

1. **Create worktree first** — `git worktree add ../repo-branch-name -b branch-name`
2. **Does task require tests?** → invoke `/write-tests` FIRST
3. **Requirements unclear?** → Ask user
4. **Will this bloat into a large PR?** → Split into smaller tasks
5. **Locate PLAN.md** — Find the project's PLAN.md for checkbox updates later
6. **Extract scope boundaries** — Read the TASK file's "In Scope" and "Out of Scope" sections for use in all sub-agent prompts

State which items were checked before proceeding.

## Execution Flow

After passing the gate, execute continuously — **no stopping until PR is created**.

```
/write-tests (if needed) → implement → checkboxes → self-review → [code-critic + minimizer] → codex → /pre-pr-verification → commit → PR
```

### Step-by-Step

1. **Tests** — If task needs tests, invoke `/write-tests` first (RED phase via test-runner)
2. **Implement** — Write the code to make tests pass
3. **GREEN phase** — Run test-runner agent to verify tests pass
4. **Checkboxes** — Update both TASK*.md AND PLAN.md: `- [ ]` → `- [x]` (MANDATORY — both files)
5. **Self-Review** — Before invoking critics, verify your own work (see [execution-core.md](~/.claude/rules/execution-core.md#self-review)):
   - Acceptance criteria met? (each criterion → evidence)
   - Tests cover acceptance criteria?
   - No debug artifacts?
   - Diff matches intent? (`git diff`)
   - No obvious bugs?
   Fix any failures before proceeding. Do not invoke critics on code you know is incomplete.
6. **code-critic + minimizer** — Run in parallel with scope context and diff focus (see [Review Governance](#review-governance)). Triage findings by severity. Fix only blocking issues. Proceed to codex when no blocking findings remain. After fixing blocking critic findings, you MUST re-run both critics. The codex review gate requires critic APPROVE markers — if critics only returned REQUEST_CHANGES, those markers don't exist and codex invocation will be blocked.
7. **codex** — Request codex review via tmux (non-blocking):
   ```bash
   ~/.claude/skills/codex-cli/scripts/tmux-codex.sh --review main "{PR title}" "$(pwd)"
   ```
   `work_dir` is required — pass the worktree/repo path. Continue with non-edit work while Codex reviews. Codex notifies via `[CODEX]` message when done.
8. **Triage codex findings** — When `[CODEX] Review complete` arrives: read findings, record evidence (`--review-complete`), triage by severity, signal verdict (`--approve`/`--re-review`/`--needs-discussion`).
9. **PR Verification** — Invoke `/pre-pr-verification` (runs test-runner + check-runner internally)
10. **Commit & PR** — Create commit and draft PR

**Note:** Step 4 (Checkboxes) MUST include PLAN.md. Forgetting PLAN.md is a common violation.

**Important:** Always use test-runner agent for running tests, check-runner for lint/typecheck. This preserves context by isolating verbose output.

## Review Governance

The review loop is the most expensive part of the workflow. These rules prevent waste.

### Scope Context in Sub-Agent Prompts

**Every** code-critic, minimizer, and codex prompt MUST include:

```
SCOPE BOUNDARIES:
- IN SCOPE: {copied from TASK file's "In scope" section}
- OUT OF SCOPE: {copied from TASK file's "Out of scope" section}
Findings on out-of-scope or pre-existing (untouched) code are automatically rejected.
Review the DIFF, not the entire codebase. Read context files for understanding only.
```

### Diff-Scoped Reviews

Instruct critics to run `git diff` and review only changed code. Pre-existing code not touched by the diff is non-blocking unless the change creates a new security-relevant interaction with it.

### Finding Triage

After receiving any critic or codex verdict, the main agent classifies each finding BEFORE acting:

| Severity | Examples | Action |
|----------|---------|--------|
| **Blocking** | Correctness bug, crash path, wrong output, security HIGH/CRITICAL | Fix → re-run per tiered re-review |
| **Non-blocking** | Style nit, "could be simpler", defensive edge case, consistency | Note and optionally fix — do NOT re-run loop |
| **Out-of-scope** | Pre-existing code, requirements not in TASK file, hallucinated requirements | Reject — note as backlog if useful |

**Only blocking findings continue the review loop.**

### Issue Ledger

Track all findings mentally across iterations:
- A closed/fixed finding cannot be re-raised without new evidence (new code added since closure).
- If a critic re-raises a closed finding, reject it and proceed.
- If a critic reverses its own prior feedback (e.g., "remove X" → "add X back"), that is **oscillation** — the main agent uses its own judgment and proceeds. Do not chase the cycle.

### Iteration Caps

| Finding Tier | Max Critic Rounds | Max Codex Rounds | Then |
|-------------|------------------|------------------|------|
| Blocking | 3 | 3 | NEEDS_DISCUSSION |
| Non-blocking | 1 | 1 | Accept or drop |

### Tiered Re-Review After Codex Fixes

| Fix Impact | Example | Re-Review Required |
|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| Targeted swap | `in` → `Object.hasOwn`, typo | test-runner only |
| Logic change within function | Restructured control flow | test-runner + critics (diff-scoped) |
| New export, changed signature, security path | Added public API | Full cascade |

## Plan Conformance (Checkbox Enforcement)

When PLAN.md exists, enforce:

1. **Both files updated:** TASK*.md AND PLAN.md checkboxes must change `- [ ]` → `- [x]` after implementation.
2. **Dependency/order changes:** If task execution reveals the need to reorder or add tasks, update PLAN.md explicitly before proceeding.
3. **Commit together:** Checkbox updates go WITH implementation, not as separate commits.

Forgetting PLAN.md is the most common violation. Verify both files are updated before proceeding to self-review.

**Pre-filled checkbox prohibition:** Never write `- [x]` when creating new checklist items. All new items start as `- [ ]` and are only checked after the work is done and verified. Pre-filling checkboxes is falsifying evidence.

## Codex Step

After critics have no remaining blocking findings, request Codex review via tmux:

**Review invocation (non-blocking):**
```bash
~/.claude/skills/codex-cli/scripts/tmux-codex.sh --review main "{PR title or change summary}" "$(pwd)"
```
This sends the review request to Codex's tmux pane. You are NOT blocked — continue with non-edit work while Codex reviews. Codex will notify you via `[CODEX] Review complete. Findings at: <path>` when done.

**Timing constraint:** Do not dispatch Codex review while critic fixes are still pending. If you edit implementation files after dispatching Codex but before Codex returns, the review is stale — Codex reviewed pre-fix code. In that case, use `--re-review` instead of `--approve` when findings arrive, even if the finding appears "pre-fixed." The goal is Codex reviews the final code, not an intermediate snapshot.

**Non-review invocation (architecture, debugging):**
```bash
~/.claude/skills/codex-cli/scripts/tmux-codex.sh --prompt "TASK: {description}. SCOPE: {changed files}." "$(pwd)"
```

**When Codex notifies you (findings ready):**
1. Read the FULL findings file with your Read tool
2. Record review evidence:
   ```bash
   ~/.claude/skills/codex-cli/scripts/tmux-codex.sh --review-complete "<findings_file>"
   ```
3. Triage each finding: blocking / non-blocking / out-of-scope
4. Update issue ledger (reject re-raised closed findings, detect oscillation)
5. Signal verdict:
   - All non-blocking: `tmux-codex.sh --approve`
   - Blocking findings fixed, re-review needed: `tmux-codex.sh --re-review "what was fixed"`
   - Unresolvable: `tmux-codex.sh --needs-discussion "reason"`

The `codex-trace.sh` hook creates evidence markers automatically from sentinel output.

**Iteration protocol:**
- Max 3 iterations for blocking findings, then NEEDS_DISCUSSION
- Non-blocking codex findings do not trigger re-review — note and proceed
- Do NOT re-run codex after convention/style fixes — only after logic or structural changes
