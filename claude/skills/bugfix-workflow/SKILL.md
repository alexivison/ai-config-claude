# Bugfix Workflow

Debug and fix bugs. Follows the same execution flow as task-workflow with these deltas.

## Deltas from Task Workflow

- **No PLAN.md checkboxes** — bugfixes aren't planned work
- **Investigation gate** — complex bugs go to Codex before implementation
- **Regression test first** — write a test that reproduces the bug before fixing

## Pre-Bugfix Gate

**STOP. Before writing ANY code:**

1. **Create worktree first** — `git worktree add ../repo-branch-name -b branch-name`
2. **Understand the bug** — Read relevant code, reproduce if possible
3. **Complex bug?** → Dispatch Codex via `tmux-codex.sh --prompt` with debugging task → `[wait for user]`

Investigation agents ALWAYS require user review before proceeding.

## Execution Flow

```
/write-tests (regression) → implement fix → self-review → [code-critic + minimizer] → codex → /pre-pr-verification → commit → PR
```

See [task-workflow/SKILL.md](../task-workflow/SKILL.md) for the full step-by-step. The only differences:
- Step 1: Regression test (not feature test) — must FAIL first (RED), then PASS after fix (GREEN)
- Step 4: Self-review checks bug root cause addressed (not just symptom masked)
- No checkbox step

## Regression Test First

1. Write a test that reproduces the bug → invoke `/write-tests`
2. Run via test-runner — it should FAIL (RED)
3. Fix the bug
4. Run test-runner again — it should PASS (GREEN)

## Codex Investigation

For complex bugs, dispatch Codex with debugging task:

```
Analyze this bug and identify the root cause.
**Bug description:** {symptom/error message}
**Relevant files:** {files where bug manifests}
Trace data/control flow, identify root cause with file:line, specify fix (don't implement).
```

**On APPROVE:** Show findings, ask user before fixing.
**On REQUEST_CHANGES:** Gather requested info, re-invoke.
**On NEEDS_DISCUSSION:** Present options, ask user.
