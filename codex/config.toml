# Codex CLI Configuration
#
# Two modes of operation:
#   Direct use (codex standalone): Uses these defaults — workspace-write + on-request approval
#   Party session (session/party.sh): CLI flags override to --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox
#
# Sub-agent: Claude Code overrides with -s read-only at call time
