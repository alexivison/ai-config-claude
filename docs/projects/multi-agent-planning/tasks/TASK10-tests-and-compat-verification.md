# Task 10 — Tests and Backward Compatibility Verification

**Dependencies:** All previous tasks
**Branch:** `feature/multi-agent-planning`

## Goal

Extend the test suite for multi-agent scenarios, verify zero-config backward compatibility (no `.party.toml` produces identical behavior to today), and ensure manifest migration works correctly. This is the final verification gate.

## Scope Boundary

**In scope:**
- New integration tests for multi-agent scenarios
- Verify existing tests all pass
- Manifest migration tests (old format → new format)
- Zero-config parity verification
- Hook test updates for renamed hooks
- Shell transport compatibility verification for the role-tag migration

**Out of scope:**
- Code changes (all previous tasks handle implementation)

## Requirements

### Zero-Config Parity Tests

Critical: with no `.party.toml`, the system must produce **identical** behavior to the pre-refactor codebase.

Test cases:
1. `Start()` with default registry → `agentCmds[RolePrimary]` produces the exact same shell command as the old `buildClaudeCmd()` with the same inputs
2. `Start()` with default registry → `agentCmds[RoleCompanion]` produces the exact same shell command as the old `buildCodexCmd()` with the same inputs
3. Classic layout with defaults → 3 panes created with the same commands and proportions
4. Sidebar layout with defaults → 2 windows, same structure
5. Master layout with defaults → tracker + primary + shell, same as before
6. Continue with old manifest → resume IDs correctly extracted and passed

### Multi-Agent Scenario Tests

1. Codex as primary: registry with `roles.primary.agent = "codex"` → primary command uses Codex CLI flags
2. Claude as companion: registry with `roles.companion.agent = "claude"` → companion command uses Claude CLI flags
3. No companion: registry with no companion role → single-agent session starts successfully
4. Start with missing companion CLI → warning logged, session continues primary-only
5. Start with missing primary CLI → error returned (session cannot start)

### Manifest Migration Tests

1. Old manifest with `claude_bin`, `codex_bin`, `claude_session_id` (extra), `codex_thread_id` (extra) → `UnmarshalJSON` produces `Agents[]` with two entries
2. Old manifest with only `claude_bin` (no codex) → `Agents[]` has one entry
3. New manifest with `Agents[]` → round-trips correctly
4. Mixed manifest (both old fields and `Agents[]`) → `Agents[]` takes precedence

### Unified Tracker Tests

1. Tracker with master + workers → hierarchy displayed correctly
2. Tracker with standalone sessions → flat list
3. Tracker with mixed (master + standalone) → correct grouping
4. Current session highlighted in detail section
5. Companion status for current session → shown inline
6. Evidence for current session → shown inline

### Hook Tests

1. `companion-gate.sh` with no companion configured → allows all commands
2. `companion-gate.sh` with companion configured → blocks `--approve`
3. `companion-trace.sh` records evidence with companion name
4. `primary-state.sh` still writes `claude-state.json`
5. Symlinks at old paths work

### Shell Transport Compatibility Tests

1. `party_role_pane_target primary` resolves a pane tagged `primary`
2. `party_role_pane_target companion` resolves a pane tagged `companion`
3. `party_role_pane_target primary` still falls back to a pane tagged `claude`
4. `party_role_pane_target companion` still falls back to a pane tagged `codex`
5. `tmux-claude.sh` delivers to a pane tagged `primary`
6. `tmux-codex.sh` delivers to a pane tagged `companion`

## Verification Checklist

Run these commands to verify:

```bash
# Go tests
cd tools/party-cli && go test ./...

# Hook tests
bash claude/hooks/tests/run-all.sh

# Shell transport smoke tests
bash tests/shell-transport-compat.sh

# Specific backward compat verification
# (these are manual checks, not automated)
# 1. Build party-cli
cd tools/party-cli && go build -o /tmp/party-cli .

# 2. Verify agent query defaults
/tmp/party-cli agent query names      # should output "claude\ncodex"
/tmp/party-cli agent query roles      # should output "primary\ncompanion"
/tmp/party-cli agent query primary-name  # should output "claude"

# 3. Verify old flags still work
/tmp/party-cli start --help | grep resume  # should show --resume-agent AND hidden --resume-claude/--resume-codex
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All hook tests pass
- [ ] Zero-config produces identical commands to pre-refactor code
- [ ] Manifest migration tests cover all old→new scenarios
- [ ] Multi-agent scenario tests cover Codex-as-primary, no-companion, missing-CLI cases
- [ ] Unified tracker tests cover hierarchy display
- [ ] Shell transport compatibility is covered for both new and legacy role tags
- [ ] No regressions in existing functionality
