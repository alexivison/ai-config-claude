# Tmux Integration — Implementation Plan

Implementation plan for replacing the subprocess-based Claude/Codex orchestration with tmux-based persistent sessions. Built for iTerm2 on macOS.

---

## Context

### Why tmux

The current system invokes Codex as a blocking subprocess (`codex exec`). Each invocation is a cold start — fresh context, one-shot output, 15-minute block on Claude. The user's workflow involves 3-7 Codex reviews per task and bidirectional Claude↔Codex planning dialogues. At 7 reviews per task, that's ~105 minutes of dead blocking time. Tmux replaces this with persistent interactive sessions where both agents retain context across reviews and Claude isn't blocked during Codex work.

### Architecture: Direct tmux, no coordinator

**Previous approach (discarded):** A coordinator daemon sitting between Claude and Codex, managing a state machine, signal files, and pane I/O. This loses context — the coordinator doesn't know *why* Claude is requesting a review or what the findings mean.

**New approach:** Claude and Codex each use `tmux send-keys` and `tmux capture-pane` directly via their Bash tools. No middleman. Each agent retains full context of what it's doing and why. The only shared infrastructure is:

1. **`party.sh`** — launches the tmux session with panes for both agents
2. **A shared state directory** (`/tmp/party-*`) — for file-based message handoff between agents
3. **Existing hooks** — markers, gates, and traces work as today with minor regex updates

This is simpler, preserves context on both sides, and leverages what both agents already have: bash access.

### What stays the same

- Sub-agents (code-critic, minimizer, test-runner, check-runner, security-scanner) remain in-process via Claude's Task tool
- The marker system's names, semantics, and invalidation logic survive intact
- All workflow skills (task-workflow, bugfix-workflow, pre-pr-verification) keep their structure — only the Codex invocation step changes
- Agent personas (Paladin/Wizard), rules, decision matrices are reused
- The review governance model (severity triage, iteration caps, tiered re-review) is unchanged

### What changes

- `call_codex.sh` / `codex-verdict.sh` → replaced by direct tmux communication (Claude sends to Codex pane)
- `call_claude.sh` → replaced by direct tmux communication (Codex sends to Claude pane)
- `codex-gate.sh` / `codex-trace.sh` → updated to match new script names (`tmux-codex.sh`)
- `settings.json` → updated permissions, hook config
- Workflow skill docs → updated Codex invocation instructions
- `CLAUDE.md`, `execution-core.md`, `autonomous-flow.md` → updated references

### iTerm2 integration

iTerm2 supports `tmux -CC` (control mode), which maps tmux panes to native iTerm2 splits/tabs. The user gets native scrollback, selection, and search in each pane. Both agents use `tmux capture-pane` and `tmux send-keys` programmatically, but the user sees native iTerm2 windows.

### `tmux send-keys` and CLI agent TUI interaction

**The problem:** Both Claude Code and Codex have rich TUIs — spinners, progress indicators, tool approval prompts, streaming output. `tmux send-keys` types characters into the terminal buffer and sends `C-m` (enter). If the target agent is mid-execution (running a tool, generating output, showing a spinner), the injected text interacts with the TUI state unpredictably. The characters may appear in the output, get swallowed by a progress indicator, or be misinterpreted as a tool approval keystroke.

**When it works cleanly:** Both Claude Code and Codex accept user input between turns — after finishing a response and before the user sends the next message. At that point the terminal is showing an input prompt, and `send-keys` text is queued as the next user message. This is the happy path.

**When it's problematic:** If agent A sends a message while agent B is mid-execution:
- The characters land in the terminal's input buffer
- When agent B finishes and returns to the input prompt, the buffered text may be partially consumed, garbled, or split across multiple inputs
- Worst case: a stray `C-m` during execution could confirm a tool approval the user didn't intend

**Mitigation strategy — gate on idle state:**

The transport scripts (`tmux-codex.sh`, `tmux-claude.sh`) should wait for the target pane to be idle before sending. A simple approach:

```bash
wait_for_idle() {
  local pane="$1" max_wait="${2:-60}" waited=0
  while (( waited < max_wait )); do
    # Capture the last line of the pane — check for input prompt indicators
    local last_line
    last_line=$(tmux capture-pane -t "$pane" -p | tail -1)
    # Both Claude Code and Codex show a prompt character when ready for input
    # Claude: ">" or "claude>" — Codex: ">" or "codex>"
    if [[ "$last_line" =~ ^\> ]] || [[ "$last_line" =~ \>\s*$ ]]; then
      return 0
    fi
    sleep 1
    ((waited++))
  done
  echo "Warning: target pane not idle after ${max_wait}s, sending anyway" >&2
  return 0  # Send anyway — better than hanging forever
}
```

This is a heuristic, not a guarantee. The prompt character detection may need tuning for specific CLI versions. But it covers the common case: don't inject text while the agent is mid-execution.

**Alternative: notification file + polling (fallback):**

If `send-keys` proves unreliable, a fallback is pure file-based notification:
1. Writer creates a notification file (e.g., `$STATE_DIR/notifications/to-claude-$TIMESTAMP.txt`)
2. Reader's skill tells it to periodically check the notifications directory
3. No terminal injection at all — just file I/O

This is slower (polling interval) but completely safe. Could be used selectively for the "Codex notifies Claude" direction where timing is less critical.

---

## Branching Strategy

All tmux work happens on a `tmux` branch of the existing `ai-config` repo. No new repository needed.

**Why not a new repo:**
- ~70% of `ai-config-tmux` would be verbatim copies of files that already exist in `ai-config`
- Every hook, rule, or shared skill change on `main` would need manual sync to the second repo — guaranteed drift
- Eventually you merge or abandon; if you merge, you do the same edits in `ai-config` anyway
- A branch gives identical isolation with zero duplication

**How it works:**

```
ai-config/
├── main          ← daily driver, current subprocess system
└── tmux          ← new files + edited files for tmux integration
```

- **Develop** on the `tmux` branch — new files are added, existing files are edited in place
- **Daily use** stays on `main` — `~/.claude` symlink points to `ai-config/claude` on `main`
- **Evaluate** by checking out `tmux` — same symlink, different branch content
- **Rollback** is `git checkout main` — instant revert, no symlink changes needed
- **Merge** when ready — `git merge tmux` into `main`, old scripts are replaced

### What changes on the `tmux` branch

**Existing files deleted (replaced by new scripts above):**

```

**Everything else is unchanged** — hooks (7 of 9), agents, scripts, technology rules, shared skills, codex rules, codex planning skill, config.toml all remain as-is on the branch.

---

## Phase 0: Prerequisites — Validate Before Building

These must be confirmed before any implementation begins. If either fails, the architecture needs redesign.

### 0.1 Codex sandbox write access to `/tmp/`

The entire file-based handoff depends on Codex writing findings to `/tmp/party-*/`. Codex is launched with `--sandbox read-only`, which may block writes outside the workspace.

**Test:**
```bash
# In a codex --full-auto --sandbox read-only session:
echo '{"test": true}' > /tmp/party-test/codex-findings-test.json
```

**If it works:** Proceed with the plan as designed.

**If it fails — fallback options (in order of preference):**
1. **`--sandbox write-only-outside-workspace`** — Codex can write to `/tmp/` but not to the repo. Check if this flag exists.
2. **Write to workspace instead** — Use `$REPO/.party/findings-$TIMESTAMP.json` instead of `/tmp/`. Gitignore `.party/`. Downside: clutters workspace.
3. **Capture pane output** — Codex writes findings as structured output to stdout. Claude uses `tmux capture-pane` to extract it. Fragile — parsing terminal output. Last resort.

### 0.2 `tmux send-keys` into idle CLI agent

Verify that `tmux send-keys` to a Claude Code / Codex pane works when the agent is waiting for input.

**Test:**
```bash
# Start Claude Code in a tmux pane, let it settle to input prompt
tmux send-keys -t test:0 "What is 2+2?" C-m
# Verify Claude processes it as a user message
```

**If it works at idle:** The `wait_for_idle()` approach in the transport scripts is viable.

**If it fails:** The TUI doesn't accept raw `send-keys` at all, and we need a different input mechanism (e.g., `--pipe` mode, stdin redirection, or Claude Code's `--input-file` flag if it exists).

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Sandbox write test: confirm Codex can write to `/tmp/party-*/` (or identify fallback)
- [ ] `send-keys` input test: confirm agents accept `tmux send-keys` as user messages when idle
- [ ] Document results — if fallbacks needed, update Phase 2/3 scripts accordingly

---

## Phase 1: Session Launcher

### 1.1 Session Launcher (`party.sh`)

The main entry point. Starts a tmux session with panes for Claude and Codex. No daemon — just setup and attach.

**iTerm2 integration:** Launch with `tmux -CC` to get native iTerm2 panes:

```bash
# Launch in iTerm2 control mode
party.sh                # Default: uses tmux -CC if TERM_PROGRAM=iTerm.app
party.sh --raw          # Force raw tmux (for SSH, non-iTerm terminals)
```

**Pane layout:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────┐
│ Pane 0: Claude              │ Pane 1: Codex                │
│ claude --dangerously-skip-  │ codex --full-auto             │
│ permissions                 │ --sandbox read-only           │
│                             │                               │
│                             │                               │
└─────────────────────────────┴──────────────────────────────┘
```

No coordinator pane. No dashboard pane. Just two agents, side by side. The user watches both panes directly in iTerm2 (native scrollback, search, selection).

### 1.2 tmux Keybindings

The default tmux keybindings (`Ctrl-b` prefix) are unfamiliar to iTerm2 users. `party.sh` applies iTerm2-like keybindings at session creation time so pane/window navigation feels natural.

These are set via `tmux set-option` and `tmux bind-key` at startup — no persistent `.tmux.conf` required. The bindings only exist while the party session is alive.

**Note on `tmux -CC` (iTerm2 control mode):** When running in control mode, iTerm2 maps tmux panes/windows to native iTerm2 tabs and splits. In that mode, your normal `Cmd-T`, `Cmd-W`, `Cmd-[`/`Cmd-]` already work because iTerm2 is managing the chrome. The keybindings below are for **raw tmux mode** (`--raw` flag, SSH, non-iTerm terminals) where you're in tmux's own UI.

```bash
configure_keybindings() {
  # ── Pane navigation (the most common action) ──────────────────────
  # Cmd-Left/Right to switch panes (like Cmd-[ / Cmd-] in iTerm2 for tab switching)
  # Note: "Cmd" doesn't exist in raw terminal — these map to Alt/Option instead.
  # iTerm2 users: remap Option-Left/Right in iTerm2 prefs to send these sequences,
  # or just use the raw bindings below.
  tmux bind-key -n M-Left  select-pane -L    # Option-Left  → go to left pane (Claude)
  tmux bind-key -n M-Right select-pane -R    # Option-Right → go to right pane (Codex)

  # Also bind arrow keys with prefix for muscle-memory overlap
  tmux bind-key Left  select-pane -L
  tmux bind-key Right select-pane -R

  # ── Window/tab management ─────────────────────────────────────────
  # Prefix + t → new window (like Cmd-T in iTerm2)
  tmux bind-key t new-window
  # Prefix + w → close current pane (like Cmd-W in iTerm2)
  tmux bind-key w kill-pane

  # Option-1 / Option-2 to jump to window by index (like Cmd-1/2 in iTerm2)
  tmux bind-key -n M-1 select-window -t 0
  tmux bind-key -n M-2 select-window -t 1

  # ── Zoom ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  # Prefix + f → toggle fullscreen on current pane (like Cmd-Shift-Enter in iTerm2)
  # (tmux default is Prefix + z, keeping both)
  tmux bind-key f resize-pane -Z

  # ── Pane labels ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
  # Show pane titles in the border so you know which is Claude vs Codex
  tmux set-option -g pane-border-status top
  tmux set-option -g pane-border-format " #[bold]#{pane_title}#[default] "
}
```

**Keybinding summary (raw tmux mode):**

| Action | Keybinding | iTerm2 equivalent |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| Switch to left pane (Claude) | `Option-Left` | `Cmd-[` or `Cmd-Left` |
| Switch to right pane (Codex) | `Option-Right` | `Cmd-]` or `Cmd-Right` |
| New window | `Ctrl-b t` | `Cmd-T` |
| Close pane | `Ctrl-b w` | `Cmd-W` |
| Jump to window 1 | `Option-1` | `Cmd-1` |
| Jump to window 2 | `Option-2` | `Cmd-2` |
| Zoom/fullscreen pane | `Ctrl-b f` | `Cmd-Shift-Enter` |
| Detach (session keeps running) | `Ctrl-b d` | *(no equivalent)* |

### 1.3 Implementation

```bash
party_start() {
  SESSION="party-$(date +%s)"
  STATE_DIR="/tmp/$SESSION"
  mkdir -p "$STATE_DIR/messages/to-codex" "$STATE_DIR/messages/to-claude"

  # Write session metadata so scripts can discover the active session
  echo "$SESSION" > "$STATE_DIR/session-name"

  # Detect iTerm2 and use control mode
  TMUX_CMD="tmux"
  if [[ "${TERM_PROGRAM:-}" == "iTerm.app" && "${PARTY_RAW:-}" != "1" ]]; then
    TMUX_CMD="tmux -CC"
  fi

  # Apply iTerm2-like keybindings for this session
  configure_keybindings

  # Create session
  $TMUX_CMD new-session -d -s "$SESSION" -n work -x 200 -y 50

  # Split into panes
  tmux split-window -h -t "$SESSION:work"  # Pane 1: Codex (right)

  # Label panes by their fantasy lore roles
  tmux select-pane -t "$SESSION:work.0" -T "The Wizard"
  tmux select-pane -t "$SESSION:work.1" -T "The Paladin"

  # Launch agents
  tmux send-keys -t "$SESSION:work.0" \
    "claude --dangerously-skip-permissions" C-m
  tmux send-keys -t "$SESSION:work.1" \
    "codex --full-auto --sandbox read-only" C-m

  # Attach (iTerm2 control mode auto-attaches)
  if [[ "$TMUX_CMD" == "tmux" ]]; then
    tmux attach -t "$SESSION"
  fi
}
```

**Teardown:**

```bash
party_stop() {
  tmux kill-session -t "$SESSION" 2>/dev/null
  rm -rf "$STATE_DIR"
}
```

**How agents discover the session:** Both `tmux-codex.sh` and `tmux-claude.sh` find the active party session by looking for `/tmp/party-*/session-name`. They read the session name from that file to construct tmux target pane addresses.

**Constraint: one session at a time.** `discover_session()` uses `head -1` to pick the first match. If multiple `/tmp/party-*` directories exist, it picks arbitrarily. This is by design — running multiple party sessions simultaneously is not supported. `party.sh --stop` cleans up the state directory on teardown to prevent stale sessions.

```bash
# Shared helper used by both tmux-codex.sh and tmux-claude.sh
discover_session() {
  local state_dir
  state_dir=$(find /tmp -maxdepth 1 -name 'party-*' -type d 2>/dev/null | head -1)
  if [[ -z "$state_dir" ]]; then
    echo "Error: No active party session found" >&2
    return 1
  fi
  SESSION_NAME=$(cat "$state_dir/session-name")
  STATE_DIR="$state_dir"
}
```

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] `session/party.sh` — session launcher with iTerm2 detection
- [ ] iTerm2-like keybindings applied at session startup (Option-Left/Right, Prefix+t/w, Option-1/2, Prefix+f)
- [ ] Pane labels ("The Wizard" / "The Paladin") shown in border
- [ ] iTerm2 control mode (`tmux -CC`) integration tested (native keybindings pass through)
- [ ] `--raw` fallback for non-iTerm terminals
- [ ] Clean teardown on SIGTERM/SIGINT
- [ ] `$STATE_DIR/messages/to-codex/` and `$STATE_DIR/messages/to-claude/` directories created on startup

---

## Phase 2: Claude → Codex Communication

### 2.1 `tmux-codex.sh` — Claude's interface to Codex

This single script replaces both `call_codex.sh` and `codex-verdict.sh`. Claude calls it via its Bash tool. The script uses `tmux send-keys` to communicate with Codex's pane and file-based handoff for structured data.

**Key principle: Claude keeps full context.** Claude knows why it's requesting a review, what the previous findings were, and what it expects. It sends the request directly and reads the response directly. No middleman losing context.

**Modes:**

| Mode | Replaces | What it does |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `--review` | `call_codex.sh --review` | Sends a short message to Codex pane via `tmux send-keys` with base branch, title, and findings file path. Codex's `tmux-handler` skill defines the review protocol. Returns immediately (non-blocking) |
| `--prompt` | `call_codex.sh --prompt` | Sends prompt text and response file path to Codex pane via `tmux send-keys`. Returns immediately (non-blocking) |
| `--approve` | `codex-verdict.sh approve` | Outputs `CODEX APPROVED` sentinel. `codex-trace.sh` hook detects this and creates evidence markers (codex-ran + codex-approved) |
| `--re-review` | `codex-verdict.sh request_changes` | Outputs `CODEX REQUEST_CHANGES` sentinel. Hook creates codex-ran marker only |
| `--needs-discussion` | `codex-verdict.sh needs_discussion` | Outputs `CODEX NEEDS_DISCUSSION` sentinel. Hook logs to trace |

**Implementation:**

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# tmux-codex.sh — Claude's direct interface to Codex via tmux
# Replaces call_codex.sh + codex-verdict.sh
set -euo pipefail

MODE="${1:?Usage: tmux-codex.sh --review|--prompt|--approve|--re-review|--needs-discussion}"

# Discover active party session
STATE_DIR=$(find /tmp -maxdepth 1 -name 'party-*' -type d 2>/dev/null | head -1)
if [[ -z "$STATE_DIR" ]]; then
  echo "Error: No active party session found" >&2
  exit 1
fi
SESSION_NAME=$(cat "$STATE_DIR/session-name")
CODEX_PANE="$SESSION_NAME:work.1"
TIMESTAMP="$(date +%s%N)"

case "$MODE" in

  --review)
    BASE="${2:-main}"
    TITLE="${3:-Code review}"
    FINDINGS_FILE="$STATE_DIR/messages/to-claude/codex-findings-$TIMESTAMP.json"

    # Just tell Codex what to review. Codex's tmux-handler skill defines
    # the review protocol: severity classification, output format, notification.
    tmux send-keys -t "$CODEX_PANE" \
      "Review the changes on this branch against $BASE. Title: $TITLE. Write findings to: $FINDINGS_FILE" C-m

    echo "CODEX_REVIEW_REQUESTED"
    echo "Findings will be written to: $FINDINGS_FILE"
    echo "Claude is NOT blocked. Codex will notify Claude via tmux when review is complete."
    echo "CODEX_REVIEW_RAN"
    ;;

  --prompt)
    PROMPT_TEXT="${2:?Missing prompt text}"
    RESPONSE_FILE="$STATE_DIR/messages/to-claude/codex-response-$TIMESTAMP.md"

    # Just send the prompt. Codex's skills define how to handle it.
    tmux send-keys -t "$CODEX_PANE" \
      "$PROMPT_TEXT — Write response to: $RESPONSE_FILE" C-m

    echo "CODEX_TASK_REQUESTED"
    echo "Response will be written to: $RESPONSE_FILE"
    echo "Codex will notify Claude via tmux when task is complete."
    ;;

  --approve)
    echo "CODEX APPROVED"
    ;;

  --re-review)
    REASON="${2:-Blocking findings fixed}"
    echo "CODEX REQUEST_CHANGES — $REASON"
    ;;

  --needs-discussion)
    REASON="${2:-Multiple valid approaches or unresolvable findings}"
    echo "CODEX NEEDS_DISCUSSION — $REASON"
    ;;

  *)
    echo "Error: Unknown mode '$MODE'" >&2
    echo "Usage: tmux-codex.sh --review|--prompt|--approve|--re-review|--needs-discussion" >&2
    exit 1
    ;;
esac
```

**How Claude uses this — the review flow:**

```
1. Claude implements code (same as today)
2. Claude runs sub-agent critics via Task tool (same as today)
3. Claude calls: tmux-codex.sh --review main "Add user auth"
   → Script sends short message to Codex pane via tmux send-keys
   → Script returns IMMEDIATELY — Claude is NOT blocked
4. Claude continues non-edit work (documentation, test planning, etc.)
5. Codex completes the review, writes findings to file, then notifies Claude
   via tmux-claude.sh → Claude sees "[CODEX] Review complete. Findings at: ..."
6. Claude reads the findings file with its Read tool
7. Claude triages each finding (blocking / non-blocking / out-of-scope)
8. Claude maintains issue ledger (same as current system — in Claude's context)
9. Claude decides:
   a. All non-blocking → calls tmux-codex.sh --approve
   b. Blocking issues → fixes them, re-runs critics, calls tmux-codex.sh --re-review
   c. Unresolvable → calls tmux-codex.sh --needs-discussion
```

**No polling needed.** Codex pushes a notification to Claude's pane when done. Claude reacts to incoming messages — same pattern in both directions.

**What Claude retains that a coordinator would lose:**
- Why it made the changes (full implementation context)
- Previous Codex findings and how it triaged them (issue ledger)
- Which findings it already fixed vs. rejected
- The re-review tier decision (targeted swap vs. logic change vs. full cascade)

**Mapping to current system:**

| Current | Tmux equivalent |
|---------|----------------|
| `call_codex.sh --review --base main --title "..."` | `tmux-codex.sh --review main "..."` |
| `call_codex.sh --prompt "..."` | `tmux-codex.sh --prompt "..."` |
| `codex-verdict.sh approve` | `tmux-codex.sh --approve` |
| `codex-verdict.sh request_changes` | `tmux-codex.sh --re-review "reason"` |
| `codex-verdict.sh needs_discussion` | `tmux-codex.sh --needs-discussion "reason"` |

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] `claude/skills/codex-cli/scripts/tmux-codex.sh` — all modes (thin transport, no protocol knowledge)
- [ ] `--review` and `--prompt` send messages via `tmux send-keys` and return immediately (non-blocking)
- [ ] `--approve`, `--re-review`, `--needs-discussion` output sentinel strings for hook detection (same sentinels as current system)
- [ ] `wait_for_idle()` check before `send-keys` (see Context section on TUI interaction)

## Phase 3: Codex → Claude Communication

### 3.1 `tmux-claude.sh` — Codex's interface to Claude

The mirror image of `tmux-codex.sh`. Codex calls this to ask Claude questions during planning or to request Claude's help investigating the codebase.

**Key principle: Codex keeps full context too.** When Codex is mid-plan and needs info from Claude, it sends the question directly, gets the answer back, and continues with full awareness of its planning context.

**Implementation:**

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# tmux-claude.sh — Codex's direct interface to Claude via tmux
# Replaces call_claude.sh
set -euo pipefail

MESSAGE="${1:?Usage: tmux-claude.sh \"message for Claude\"}"

# Discover active party session
STATE_DIR=$(find /tmp -maxdepth 1 -name 'party-*' -type d 2>/dev/null | head -1)
if [[ -z "$STATE_DIR" ]]; then
  echo "Error: No active party session found" >&2
  exit 1
fi
SESSION_NAME=$(cat "$STATE_DIR/session-name")
CLAUDE_PANE="$SESSION_NAME:work.0"

# Just send the [CODEX] prefixed message to Claude's pane.
# Codex's claude-cli skill defines what messages to send and when.
# Claude's tmux-handler skill defines how to respond.
tmux send-keys -t "$CLAUDE_PANE" "[CODEX] $MESSAGE" C-m

echo "CLAUDE_MESSAGE_SENT"
```

**How Codex uses this — the planning dialogue flow:**

```
1. User sends planning task to Codex pane directly
2. Codex works on the plan...
3. Codex needs to know how the database connection pool works
4. Codex follows its claude-cli skill: creates a response file path, calls:
   tmux-claude.sh "Question: How does the DB connection pool work in src/db/? Write response to: <response_file>"
   → Script sends [CODEX] prefixed message to Claude's pane, returns immediately
5. Claude's tmux-handler skill fires: sees "[CODEX] Question..."
6. Claude investigates the codebase, writes answer to the response file
7. Claude notifies Codex via tmux-codex.sh --prompt "Response ready at: <response_file>"
8. Codex reads the response file, incorporates the answer, continues planning
```

**Multi-turn dialogue:** Multiple exchanges work naturally. Each call creates unique timestamped files. Both agents retain their full context across exchanges because they're persistent tmux sessions.

**Key design: skills define protocol, scripts are just transport.**

- Codex's `claude-cli` skill tells Codex *when* and *how* to contact Claude (message formats, file conventions)
- Claude's `tmux-handler` skill tells Claude *how* to handle incoming `[CODEX]` messages (triage, investigate, respond)
- `tmux-claude.sh` just sends `[CODEX] $MESSAGE` to Claude's pane — no protocol knowledge in the script

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] `codex/skills/claude-cli/scripts/tmux-claude.sh` — thin transport: sends `[CODEX]` prefixed message to Claude's pane
- [ ] Non-blocking (returns immediately, other agent notifies via tmux when done)

---

## Phase 4: Agent Skills for tmux

The scripts (`tmux-codex.sh`, `tmux-claude.sh`) are just thin transport — they send a short message via tmux. The actual behavior (how to review, what format to use, how to notify) lives in skills on each agent's side. This mirrors the current system where `codex exec review` works because Codex has built-in review logic, not because the calling script tells it every detail.

### 4.1 Codex: `tmux-handler` Skill

Defines how Codex handles incoming messages from Claude via tmux. Claude may send review requests, tasks, plan review requests, or other work. This is the Codex-side counterpart of Claude's `tmux-handler` skill.

**`codex/skills/tmux-handler/SKILL.md`:**

```markdown
# tmux-handler — Handle incoming messages from Claude via tmux

## Trigger

You see a message in your tmux pane from Claude (prefixed with `[CLAUDE]` or sent via `tmux-codex.sh`).

## Message types

### Review request
Message asks you to review changes against a base branch.

1. **Get the diff**: Run `git diff $(git merge-base HEAD <base>)..HEAD` to see the changes
2. **Review scope**: Review changed files AND adjacent files (callers, callees, types, tests)
   for: correctness bugs, crash paths, security issues, wrong output, architectural concerns
3. **Classify each finding**:
   - **blocking**: correctness bug, crash path, wrong output, security HIGH/CRITICAL
   - **non-blocking**: style nit, "could be simpler", defensive edge case, consistency preference
4. **Write findings** to the file path specified in the message, using this JSON format:
   ```json
   {
     "findings": [
       {
         "id": "F1",
         "file": "path/to/file.ts",
         "line": 42,
         "severity": "blocking",
         "category": "correctness|security|architecture|style|performance",
         "description": "Clear description of the issue",
         "suggestion": "How to fix it"
       }
     ],
     "summary": "One paragraph summary of the review",
     "stats": { "blocking_count": 0, "non_blocking_count": 0, "files_reviewed": 0 }
   }
   ```
5. **Do NOT include a "verdict" field.** You produce findings — the verdict is Claude's decision.
6. **Notify Claude** when done:
   ```bash
   ~/.codex/skills/claude-cli/scripts/tmux-claude.sh "Review complete. Findings at: <findings_file>"
   ```

### Re-review request
Claude fixed blocking issues and requests another pass.

- Verify previous blocking issues were addressed
- Flag only genuinely NEW issues
- Do NOT re-raise findings that were already addressed

### Task request
Claude asks you to investigate or work on something.

1. Perform the requested task
2. Write results to the file path specified (if given)
3. Notify Claude: `tmux-claude.sh "Task complete. Response at: <path>"`

### Plan review request
Claude shares a plan and asks for your assessment.

1. Read the plan
2. Evaluate feasibility, risks, missing steps
3. Write feedback to the specified file (same findings JSON format, but categories may include `architecture`, `feasibility`, `missing-step`)
4. Notify Claude: `tmux-claude.sh "Plan review complete. Findings at: <path>"`

### Question from Claude
Claude asks for information or your opinion.

1. Read the question
2. Investigate the codebase or reason about the answer
3. Write response to the specified file
4. Notify Claude: `tmux-claude.sh "Response ready at: <path>"`
```

### 4.2 Codex: `claude-cli` Skill (rewritten)

Defines when and how Codex contacts Claude via tmux. This replaces the old `claude-cli/SKILL.md` that used `call_claude.sh`.

**`codex/skills/claude-cli/SKILL.md`:**

```markdown
# claude-cli — Communicate with Claude via tmux

## When to contact Claude

- **During review**: After writing findings to the file, notify Claude that review is complete
- **During planning**: When you need codebase context that would require extensive exploration
  (e.g., "how does the auth middleware chain work?", "what calls this function?")
- **During tasks**: When you need Claude to investigate something in parallel

## Discovering the session state directory

Before sending messages, discover the active party session:
```bash
STATE_DIR=$(find /tmp -maxdepth 1 -name 'party-*' -type d 2>/dev/null | head -1)
```
Use `$STATE_DIR` to construct file paths for questions and responses.

## How to contact Claude

Use the transport script:
```bash
~/.codex/skills/claude-cli/scripts/tmux-claude.sh "<message>"
```

This sends a `[CODEX]` prefixed message to Claude's tmux pane. The script returns immediately — you are NOT blocked.

## Message conventions

### Notify review complete
After writing findings to the specified file:
```bash
~/.codex/skills/claude-cli/scripts/tmux-claude.sh "Review complete. Findings at: <findings_file>"
```

### Ask a question
When you need information from Claude:
```bash
RESPONSE_FILE="$STATE_DIR/messages/to-codex/response-$(date +%s%N).md"
~/.codex/skills/claude-cli/scripts/tmux-claude.sh "Question: <your question>. Write response to: $RESPONSE_FILE"
```

### Report task completion
After completing a delegated task:
```bash
~/.codex/skills/claude-cli/scripts/tmux-claude.sh "Task complete. Response at: <response_file>"
```

## Handling Claude's responses

When you see a message in your pane from Claude (e.g., "Response ready at: <path>"):
1. Read the response file
2. Incorporate the answer into your current work
3. Continue — you have full context of what you were doing before asking

## Important

- Each exchange creates unique timestamped files — multi-turn dialogue works naturally
- You retain your full context across exchanges (persistent tmux session)
- Keep questions specific and actionable — Claude will investigate the codebase for you
- Do NOT ask Claude to make code changes. You make changes, Claude reviews.
```

### 4.3 Claude: `tmux-handler` Skill

Defines how Claude handles incoming messages from Codex's tmux pane.

**`claude/skills/tmux-handler/SKILL.md`:**

```markdown
# tmux-handler — Handle incoming messages from Codex via tmux

## Trigger

You see a message in your pane prefixed with `[CODEX]`. These are from Codex's tmux pane.

## Message types

### Review complete
Message: `[CODEX] Review complete. Findings at: <path>`

1. Read the FULL findings file with your Read tool
2. Triage each finding: blocking / non-blocking / out-of-scope
3. Update your issue ledger (reject re-raised closed findings, detect oscillation)
4. Decide verdict:
   - All non-blocking → `tmux-codex.sh --approve`
   - Blocking findings → fix them, choose re-review tier, then `tmux-codex.sh --re-review`
   - Unresolvable → `tmux-codex.sh --needs-discussion "reason"`

### Question from Codex
Message: `[CODEX] Question waiting. Read: <question_file> — Write response to: <response_file>`

1. Read the question file
2. Investigate the codebase to answer the question
3. Write your response to the specified response file
4. Notify Codex: `tmux-codex.sh --prompt "Response ready at: <response_file>"`

### Task complete
Message: `[CODEX] Task complete. Response at: <path>`

1. Read the response file
2. Continue your workflow with the information Codex provided
```

### 4.4 Claude: `codex-cli` Skill (rewritten)

Defines when and how Claude contacts Codex via tmux. This replaces the old `codex-cli/SKILL.md` that used `call_codex.sh` and `codex-verdict.sh`.

**`claude/skills/codex-cli/SKILL.md`:**

```markdown
# codex-cli — Communicate with Codex via tmux

## When to contact Codex

- **For code review**: After implementing changes and passing sub-agent critics, request Codex review
- **For tasks**: When you need Codex to investigate or work on something in parallel
- **For verdict**: After triaging Codex's findings, signal your decision

## How to contact Codex

Use the transport script:
```bash
~/.claude/skills/codex-cli/scripts/tmux-codex.sh <mode> [args...]
```

## Modes

### Request review (non-blocking)
After implementing changes and passing sub-agent critics:
```bash
~/.claude/skills/codex-cli/scripts/tmux-codex.sh --review <base_branch> "<PR title>"
```
This sends a message to Codex's pane. You are NOT blocked — continue with non-edit work while Codex reviews. Codex will notify you via `[CODEX] Review complete. Findings at: <path>` when done. Handle that message per your `tmux-handler` skill.

### Send a task (non-blocking)
```bash
~/.claude/skills/codex-cli/scripts/tmux-codex.sh --prompt "<task description>"
```
Returns immediately. Codex will notify you when done.

### Signal verdict (after triaging findings)
```bash
# All findings non-blocking — approve
~/.claude/skills/codex-cli/scripts/tmux-codex.sh --approve

# Blocking findings fixed, request re-review
~/.claude/skills/codex-cli/scripts/tmux-codex.sh --re-review "what was fixed"

# Unresolvable after max iterations
~/.claude/skills/codex-cli/scripts/tmux-codex.sh --needs-discussion "reason"
```
Verdict modes output sentinel strings that hooks detect to create evidence markers.

## Important

- `--review` and `--prompt` are NON-BLOCKING. Continue working while Codex processes.
- Verdict modes (`--approve`, `--re-review`, `--needs-discussion`) are instant — they output sentinels for hook detection.
- You decide the verdict. Codex produces findings, you triage them.
- Before calling `--review`, ensure sub-agent critics have passed (codex-gate.sh enforces this).
- Before calling `--approve`, ensure codex-ran marker exists (codex-gate.sh enforces this).
```

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] `codex/skills/tmux-handler/SKILL.md` — Codex's inbound handler (reviews, tasks, plan reviews, questions from Claude)
- [ ] `codex/skills/claude-cli/SKILL.md` — Codex's outbound protocol (when/how to contact Claude, message conventions)
- [ ] `claude/skills/tmux-handler/SKILL.md` — Claude's handler for `[CODEX]` messages (triage, verdict, question answering)
- [ ] `claude/skills/codex-cli/SKILL.md` — Claude's outbound protocol (when/how to contact Codex, all modes, verdict semantics)

---

## Phase 5: Hook Updates

### 5.1 Updated `codex-gate.sh`

Same logic as today, but regex matches `tmux-codex.sh` instead of `call_codex.sh`:

```bash
# Only gate tmux-codex.sh invocations
echo "$COMMAND" | grep -qE '(^|[;&|] *)([^ ]*/)?tmux-codex\.sh' || { echo '{}'; exit 0; }

# Gate 1: --review requires critic APPROVE markers
if echo "$COMMAND" | grep -qE 'tmux-codex\.sh +--review'; then
  # ... same marker checks as today ...
fi

# Gate 2: --approve requires codex-ran marker
if echo "$COMMAND" | grep -qE 'tmux-codex\.sh +--approve'; then
  # ... same codex-ran check as today ...
fi
```

### 5.2 Updated `codex-trace.sh`

Same logic as today, but detects `tmux-codex.sh` output sentinels instead of `call_codex.sh`:

```bash
# Detect tmux-codex.sh invocations
echo "$command" | grep -qE '(^|[;&|] *)([^ ]*/)?tmux-codex\.sh' || exit 0

# Same sentinel detection as today:
# CODEX_REVIEW_RAN → create codex-ran marker
# CODEX APPROVED → create codex-approved marker
# CODEX REQUEST_CHANGES → create codex-ran marker only
# CODEX NEEDS_DISCUSSION → log only
```

The sentinel strings in `tmux-codex.sh` are identical to the current `call_codex.sh` / `codex-verdict.sh` output, so `codex-trace.sh` only needs the regex update. Evidence markers are created by the same hook, triggered by the same sentinels. The dual-layer defense (codex-ran + codex-approved) is preserved.

### 5.3 All other hooks — unchanged

These hooks work identically because they don't reference Codex invocation scripts:

- `agent-trace.sh` — sub-agents still use Task tool
- `marker-invalidate.sh` — still fires on Edit/Write
- `skill-marker.sh` — still creates skill markers
- `pr-gate.sh` — still checks the same `/tmp/claude-*` marker files
- `worktree-guard.sh` — still checks worktree state
- `session-cleanup.sh` — still cleans up on session end
- `skill-eval.sh` — still evaluates skill triggers

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] `claude/hooks/codex-gate.sh` — updated regex only
- [ ] `claude/hooks/codex-trace.sh` — updated regex only
- [ ] All other hooks copied unchanged

---

## Phase 6: Documentation Updates

### 6.1 Updated Workflow Skills

**`task-workflow/SKILL.md` — Steps 7 and 8 change:**

Current step 7:
```
7. **codex** — Invoke `~/.claude/skills/codex-cli/scripts/call_codex.sh` for combined code + architecture review
```

New step 7:
```
7. **codex** — Request codex review via tmux:
   ```bash
   ~/.claude/skills/codex-cli/scripts/tmux-codex.sh --review main "{PR title}"
   ```
   This sends the review to Codex's tmux pane. You are NOT blocked — continue with
   non-edit work while Codex reviews. Codex will notify you via tmux when findings are ready.
```

Current step 8:
```
8. **Handle codex verdict** — Triage findings (see Finding Triage). Classify fix impact for tiered re-review. Signal verdict via `codex-verdict.sh`.
```

New step 8:
```
8. **Triage codex findings** — When the findings file appears:
   a. Read the FULL findings file (not just the summary)
   b. Triage each finding: blocking / non-blocking / out-of-scope
   c. Update issue ledger (reject re-raised closed findings, detect oscillation)
   d. If no blocking findings:
      ```bash
      ~/.claude/skills/codex-cli/scripts/tmux-codex.sh --approve
      ```
   e. If blocking findings need fixes: fix them, choose re-review tier:
      - Targeted swap (typo): run test-runner only → if pass, `tmux-codex.sh --approve`
      - Logic change: re-run critics → if approve, `tmux-codex.sh --re-review`
      - New export/signature: full cascade → `tmux-codex.sh --re-review`
   f. If unresolvable (max 3 iterations):
      ```bash
      ~/.claude/skills/codex-cli/scripts/tmux-codex.sh --needs-discussion "reason"
      ```
```

**`bugfix-workflow/SKILL.md`** — Same pattern: replace `call_codex.sh` with `tmux-codex.sh`, replace `codex-verdict.sh` with `tmux-codex.sh --approve/--re-review/--needs-discussion`.

**`codex-cli/SKILL.md`** — Full rewrite: describe the tmux-based invocation pattern, file-based handoff, push notification (Codex notifies Claude), and all modes. Document that `--review` and `--prompt` are non-blocking.

### 6.2 Updated Rules

**`execution-core.md`:**
- Codex Review Gate section: same logic, `tmux-codex.sh` instead of `call_codex.sh`
- Decision matrix: unchanged logic, updated script names

**`autonomous-flow.md`:**
- Violation patterns: `call_codex.sh` → `tmux-codex.sh`, `codex-verdict.sh` → `tmux-codex.sh --approve`
- Checkpoint markers: same markers, same hooks (just updated regex)

**`CLAUDE.md`:**
- Sub-agents table: replace `call_codex.sh` / `codex-verdict.sh` with `tmux-codex.sh` (all modes)
- Add tmux context section: "You are running in a tmux pane alongside Codex. You can communicate with Codex directly via `tmux-codex.sh`. Codex reviews are non-blocking — you can continue working while Codex reviews."
- Add `[CODEX]` message convention: "Messages prefixed with `[CODEX]` are from Codex's tmux pane. Read the referenced question file, investigate, and write your response to the specified response file."
- Add verdict authority note: same as before (Claude triages, Claude decides)

**`codex/AGENTS.md`:**
- Add tmux context: "You are running as a persistent interactive session in a tmux pane alongside Claude. You can communicate with Claude directly via `tmux-claude.sh`. When asked to write output to a file, always comply — file-based handoff is how agents exchange structured data. You retain context across reviews within this session. IMPORTANT: You produce FINDINGS, not verdicts."

### 6.3 Updated Settings

**`settings.json`:**

```diff
- "Bash(~/.claude/skills/codex-cli/scripts/call_codex.sh:*)",
- "Bash(~/.claude/skills/codex-cli/scripts/codex-verdict.sh:*)",
+ "Bash(~/.claude/skills/codex-cli/scripts/tmux-codex.sh:*)",
```

Hook config: no structural changes needed — `codex-gate.sh` and `codex-trace.sh` keep their names, just updated regex inside.

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Updated `task-workflow/SKILL.md`
- [ ] Updated `bugfix-workflow/SKILL.md`
- [ ] Rewritten `codex-cli/SKILL.md`
- [ ] Updated `execution-core.md`
- [ ] Updated `autonomous-flow.md`
- [ ] Updated `CLAUDE.md`
- [ ] Updated `codex/AGENTS.md`
- [ ] Updated `settings.json`

---

## Phase 7: Testing

### 7.1 Test Infrastructure

Shell-based test harness. Mock agents simulate Claude and Codex behavior.

**`mock-claude.sh`:**
```bash
# Simulates Claude Code responses
# Reads from stdin (tmux send-keys input), pattern-matches on [CODEX] messages
while IFS= read -r line; do
  case "$line" in
    *"[CODEX] Review complete. Findings at:"*)
      findings_file=$(echo "$line" | grep -oP 'Findings at: \K\S+')
      echo "Mock Claude reading findings from $findings_file"
      # Simulate triage — if no blocking findings, approve
      if jq -e '.stats.blocking_count == 0' "$findings_file" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
        echo "CODEX APPROVED"
      else
        echo "CODEX REQUEST_CHANGES — Blocking findings need fixes"
      fi
      ;;
    *"[CODEX] Question:"*)
      response_file=$(echo "$line" | grep -oP 'Write response to: \K\S+')
      echo "The database uses a pooled connection with max 10 connections." > "$response_file"
      echo "Mock Claude wrote response to $response_file"
      ;;
    *)
      echo "Acknowledged: $line"
      ;;
  esac
done
```

**`mock-codex.sh`:**
```bash
# Simulates Codex responses
# Reads from stdin (tmux send-keys input), extracts findings path from direct message
REVIEWS_BEFORE_APPROVE="${MOCK_REVIEWS:-3}"
review_count=0

while IFS= read -r line; do
  case "$line" in
    *"Review the changes"*"Write findings to:"*)
      ((review_count++))
      # Extract findings file path directly from the message (no prompt file)
      findings_file=$(echo "$line" | grep -oP 'Write findings to: \K\S+')
      if (( review_count >= REVIEWS_BEFORE_APPROVE )); then
        echo '{"findings":[],"summary":"All issues addressed.","stats":{"blocking_count":0,"non_blocking_count":0,"files_reviewed":5}}' > "$findings_file"
      else
        echo '{"findings":[{"id":"F1","file":"src/auth.ts","line":42,"severity":"blocking","category":"correctness","description":"Missing null check","suggestion":"Add null guard"}],"summary":"Found 1 blocking issue.","stats":{"blocking_count":1,"non_blocking_count":0,"files_reviewed":5}}' > "$findings_file"
      fi
      # Notify Claude via tmux-claude.sh (simulated)
      echo "[MOCK] Review complete. Would call: tmux-claude.sh 'Review complete. Findings at: $findings_file'"
      ;;
  esac
done
```

### 7.2 Test Cases

**Session tests (`test-party.sh`):**
- [ ] `party.sh` creates tmux session with 2 panes
- [ ] `party.sh --raw` works without iTerm2
- [ ] `party.sh --stop` cleanly tears down session and state dir
- [ ] State directory has correct subdirectories

**Claude→Codex tests (`test-tmux-codex.sh`):**
- [ ] `--review` sends message with base branch, title, and findings path to Codex pane
- [ ] `--review` returns immediately (non-blocking)
- [ ] `--prompt` sends prompt text and response path to Codex pane
- [ ] `--approve` outputs correct sentinel string (`CODEX APPROVED`)
- [ ] `--re-review` outputs correct sentinel string (`CODEX REQUEST_CHANGES`)
- [ ] `--needs-discussion` outputs correct sentinel string (`CODEX NEEDS_DISCUSSION`)
- [ ] Script fails gracefully when no party session exists

**Codex→Claude tests (`test-tmux-claude.sh`):**
- [ ] `[CODEX]` prefixed message sent to Claude pane
- [ ] Script returns immediately (non-blocking)
- [ ] Script fails gracefully when no party session exists

**Hook tests (`test-hooks.sh`):**
- [ ] `codex-gate.sh` blocks `tmux-codex.sh --review` without critic markers
- [ ] `codex-gate.sh` allows `tmux-codex.sh --review` with critic markers
- [ ] `codex-gate.sh` blocks `tmux-codex.sh --approve` without codex-ran marker
- [ ] `codex-trace.sh` creates codex-ran marker on CODEX_REVIEW_RAN sentinel
- [ ] `codex-trace.sh` creates codex-approved marker on CODEX APPROVED sentinel

**Integration test (`test-integration.sh`):**
- [ ] Full review cycle with mock agents: Claude implements → critics → tmux-codex --review → Codex writes findings → Claude reads → tmux-codex --approve → markers created
- [ ] Multi-review cycle: 3 rounds of findings → fixes → re-review → eventual approve
- [ ] Planning dialogue: Codex asks Claude → Claude responds → Codex reads response
- [ ] Bidirectional: Claude reviews via Codex, then Codex asks Claude a question, both in same session

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] `tests/mock-claude.sh`, `tests/mock-codex.sh`
- [ ] `tests/test-party.sh`
- [ ] `tests/test-tmux-codex.sh`
- [ ] `tests/test-tmux-claude.sh`
- [ ] `tests/test-hooks.sh`
- [ ] `tests/test-integration.sh`
- [ ] `tests/run-tests.sh`

## Phase 8: iTerm2 Setup & Migration

### 8.1 iTerm2 Keybindings

Set up keybindings so launching and managing party sessions is a single keystroke.

**Setup (one-time, via iTerm2 Settings):**

1. **Create a "Party" profile** using iTerm2 dynamic profiles:

```json
{
  "Profiles": [
    {
      "Name": "Party",
      "Guid": "party-session-profile",
      "Custom Command": "Yes",
      "Command": "~/ai-config/session/party.sh",
      "Working Directory": "",
      "Custom Directory": "Recycle",
      "Tags": ["ai-config", "party"]
    }
  ]
}
```

2. **Add keybindings** (Settings → Keys → Key Bindings → `+`):

| Keybind | Action | Effect |
|---------|--------|--------|
| `Cmd+Shift+P` | New Tab with Profile → Party | Launch a new party session |
| `Cmd+Shift+K` | Send Text: `party.sh --stop\n` | Kill the current party session |

### 8.2 Migration path

```
Week 0:   Prerequisites (Phase 0) — validate sandbox writes + send-keys before building anything
Week 1:   Session launcher (Phase 1) + tmux-codex.sh (Phase 2) + tmux-claude.sh (Phase 3)
Week 2:   Agent skills (Phase 4) + hook updates (Phase 5) + documentation (Phase 6)
Week 3:   Testing (Phase 7) + iTerm2 setup (Phase 8)
Week 4:   Integration testing with real agents, side-by-side evaluation
          → Decision: merge tmux branch to main, keep on branch, or abandon
```

**Switching systems:**
```bash
# Use tmux system
cd ~/ai-config && git checkout tmux

# Use subprocess system (rollback)
cd ~/ai-config && git checkout main
```

No symlink changes needed — `~/.claude` already points to `~/ai-config/claude`. Switching branches changes the content the symlink resolves to.

**Merging when ready:**
```bash
cd ~/ai-config && git checkout main && git merge tmux
```

After merge, `main` has the tmux system and the old `call_codex.sh`/`codex-verdict.sh`/`call_claude.sh` scripts are deleted. The subprocess system is still available via `git checkout main~1` if needed.

## Risk Register

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| `tmux send-keys` arrives while agent is mid-execution | High | Transport scripts use `wait_for_idle()` heuristic (see Context section). Fallback: file-based notification + polling |
| Codex ignores file-write instruction | Medium | `tmux-handler` skill explicitly instructs file write; Codex's AGENTS.md reinforces. Fall back to `tmux capture-pane` |
| Large diff exceeds tmux send-keys limit | Low | Not applicable: Codex runs its own git diff in the shared repo |
| `[CODEX]` message confused with user input | Low | Distinctive prefix; documented in CLAUDE.md and `tmux-handler` skill |
| Agent crashes | Medium | User can see both panes; restart agent manually or re-run `party.sh` |
| Race condition: code edit during Codex review | Medium | `marker-invalidate.sh` still fires on Edit/Write — same as today |
| Codex sandbox write access to `/tmp/` | ~~High~~ | **Resolved in Phase 0.** Tested before implementation begins. Fallback options documented |
| Claude rubber-stamps --approve without reading findings | Medium | Same risk as today; mitigated by `codex-gate.sh` (gate 2: codex-ran required) and `tmux-handler` skill instructions |
| Codex forgets to notify Claude after writing findings | Medium | `tmux-handler` skill explicitly instructs notification step; Codex's AGENTS.md reinforces convention |
| Codex takes too long, no notification arrives | Low | User can see both panes in iTerm2 and nudge either agent; could add a timeout convention in skill docs |
| Multiple party sessions cause script confusion | Low | `discover_session()` uses `head -1` — only one session supported at a time. Document as constraint |

## Success Criteria

1. **Full review cycle works:** Claude implements → critics → `tmux-codex.sh --review` → Codex writes findings → Claude reads → triages → `tmux-codex.sh --approve` → markers created → PR
2. **Multi-review cycle works:** Multiple rounds with Claude triaging each, maintaining issue ledger, eventual approve — all with persistent Codex context
3. **Claude keeps full context:** No context loss between review iterations (Claude remembers previous findings, its issue ledger, why it made changes)
4. **Codex keeps full context:** Codex remembers previous reviews within the session (can focus on "was this fixed?" rather than re-reviewing from scratch)
5. **Planning dialogue works:** Codex asks Claude via `tmux-claude.sh`, Claude responds, Codex continues — both retain context
6. **Bidirectional:** Claude→Codex (reviews, tasks) and Codex→Claude (questions) both work
7. **Non-blocking:** Claude can work while Codex reviews; Codex can work while Claude answers
8. **All existing hooks still work:** agent-trace, marker-invalidate, skill-marker, pr-gate, worktree-guard, session-cleanup, skill-eval
9. **Markers are compatible:** Same `/tmp/claude-*` paths, same semantics, `pr-gate.sh` works unchanged
10. **iTerm2 UX:** `tmux -CC` gives native panes with scrollback and search
11. **Tests pass:** All test suites green
12. **Rollback works:** `git checkout main` reverts to subprocess model instantly

### Deleted files (replaced by new scripts above)

```
claude/skills/codex-cli/scripts/call_codex.sh        # Replaced by tmux-codex.sh
claude/skills/codex-cli/scripts/codex-verdict.sh     # Merged into tmux-codex.sh --approve/--re-review/--needs-discussion
codex/skills/claude-cli/scripts/call_claude.sh       # Replaced by tmux-claude.sh
```

### Unchanged (no modifications needed)

All other files remain identical to `main`. Because this is a branch, they don't need to be copied — they're just there.

## Appendix B: Dependencies

| Dependency | Required | Install | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|---------|---------|
| `tmux` | Yes | `brew install tmux` | Terminal multiplexer — core infrastructure |
| `jq` | Yes | `brew install jq` | JSON parsing for hook input |
| `claude` | Yes | `curl -fsSL https://cli.anthropic.com/install.sh \| sh` | Claude Code CLI |
| `codex` | Yes | `brew install --cask codex` | Codex CLI |
| iTerm2 | Recommended | `brew install --cask iterm2` | Terminal with native tmux integration. Raw tmux works without it |

Note: `fswatch` is no longer needed — there's no coordinator daemon watching for signal files. Agents notify each other via `tmux send-keys` (push, not poll).
