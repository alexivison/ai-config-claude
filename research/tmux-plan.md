# Tmux Integration — Implementation Plan

Implementation plan for replacing the subprocess-based Claude/Codex orchestration with tmux-based persistent sessions. Built for iTerm2 on macOS.

---

## Context

### Why tmux

The current system invokes Codex as a blocking subprocess (`codex exec`). Each invocation is a cold start — fresh context, one-shot output, 15-minute block on Claude. The user's workflow involves 3-7 Codex reviews per task and bidirectional Claude↔Codex planning dialogues. At 7 reviews per task, that's ~105 minutes of dead blocking time. Tmux replaces this with persistent interactive sessions where both agents retain context across reviews and Claude isn't blocked during Codex work.

### Architecture: Direct tmux, no coordinator

**Previous approach (discarded):** A coordinator daemon sitting between Claude and Codex, managing a state machine, signal files, and pane I/O. This loses context — the coordinator doesn't know *why* Claude is requesting a review or what the findings mean.

**New approach:** Claude and Codex each use `tmux send-keys` and `tmux capture-pane` directly via their Bash tools. No middleman. Each agent retains full context of what it's doing and why. The only shared infrastructure is:

1. **`party.sh`** — launches the tmux session with panes for both agents
2. **A shared state directory** (`/tmp/party-*`) — for file-based message handoff between agents
3. **Existing hooks** — markers, gates, and traces work as today with minor regex updates

This is simpler, preserves context on both sides, and leverages what both agents already have: bash access.

### What stays the same

- Sub-agents (code-critic, minimizer, test-runner, check-runner, security-scanner) remain in-process via Claude's Task tool
- The marker system's names, semantics, and invalidation logic survive intact
- All workflow skills (task-workflow, bugfix-workflow, pre-pr-verification) keep their structure — only the Codex invocation step changes
- Agent personas (Paladin/Wizard), rules, decision matrices are reused
- The review governance model (severity triage, iteration caps, tiered re-review) is unchanged

### What changes

- `call_codex.sh` / `codex-verdict.sh` → replaced by direct tmux communication (Claude sends to Codex pane)
- `call_claude.sh` → replaced by direct tmux communication (Codex sends to Claude pane)
- `codex-gate.sh` / `codex-trace.sh` → updated to match new script names (`tmux-codex.sh`)
- `settings.json` → updated permissions, hook config
- Workflow skill docs → updated Codex invocation instructions
- `CLAUDE.md`, `execution-core.md`, `autonomous-flow.md` → updated references

### iTerm2 integration

iTerm2 supports `tmux -CC` (control mode), which maps tmux panes to native iTerm2 splits/tabs. The user gets native scrollback, selection, and search in each pane. Both agents use `tmux capture-pane` and `tmux send-keys` programmatically, but the user sees native iTerm2 windows.

---

## New Repo: `ai-config-tmux`

This is built as a **new repository** alongside the existing `ai-config`. Reasoning:

1. Current system works and is used daily — can't break it during development
2. The 2 critical hooks (`codex-gate.sh`, `codex-trace.sh`) are structurally incompatible — they regex-match `call_codex.sh` at the Bash tool call level, which doesn't exist in tmux
3. Zero test infrastructure exists — new repo builds validation from day one
4. Can evaluate side-by-side before committing to migration

## Phase 1: Session Launcher

### 1.1 Session Launcher (`party.sh`)

The main entry point. Starts a tmux session with panes for Claude and Codex. No daemon — just setup and attach.

**iTerm2 integration:** Launch with `tmux -CC` to get native iTerm2 panes:

```bash
# Launch in iTerm2 control mode
party.sh                # Default: uses tmux -CC if TERM_PROGRAM=iTerm.app
party.sh --raw          # Force raw tmux (for SSH, non-iTerm terminals)
```

**Pane layout:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────┐
│ Pane 0: Claude              │ Pane 1: Codex                │
│ claude --dangerously-skip-  │ codex --full-auto             │
│ permissions                 │ --sandbox read-only           │
│                             │                               │
│                             │                               │
└─────────────────────────────┴──────────────────────────────┘
```

No coordinator pane. No dashboard pane. Just two agents, side by side. The user watches both panes directly in iTerm2 (native scrollback, search, selection).

**Implementation:**

```bash
party_start() {
  SESSION="party-$(date +%s)"
  STATE_DIR="/tmp/$SESSION"
  mkdir -p "$STATE_DIR/messages/to-codex" "$STATE_DIR/messages/to-claude"

  # Write session metadata so scripts can discover the active session
  echo "$SESSION" > "$STATE_DIR/session-name"

  # Detect iTerm2 and use control mode
  TMUX_CMD="tmux"
  if [[ "${TERM_PROGRAM:-}" == "iTerm.app" && "${PARTY_RAW:-}" != "1" ]]; then
    TMUX_CMD="tmux -CC"
  fi

  # Create session
  $TMUX_CMD new-session -d -s "$SESSION" -n work -x 200 -y 50

  # Split into panes
  tmux split-window -h -t "$SESSION:work"  # Pane 1: Codex (right)

  # Launch agents
  tmux send-keys -t "$SESSION:work.0" \
    "claude --dangerously-skip-permissions" C-m
  tmux send-keys -t "$SESSION:work.1" \
    "codex --full-auto --sandbox read-only" C-m

  # Attach (iTerm2 control mode auto-attaches)
  if [[ "$TMUX_CMD" == "tmux" ]]; then
    tmux attach -t "$SESSION"
  fi
}
```

**Teardown:**

```bash
party_stop() {
  tmux kill-session -t "$SESSION" 2>/dev/null
  rm -rf "$STATE_DIR"
}
```

**How agents discover the session:** Both `tmux-codex.sh` and `tmux-claude.sh` find the active party session by looking for `/tmp/party-*/session-name`. They read the session name from that file to construct tmux target pane addresses.

```bash
# Shared helper used by both tmux-codex.sh and tmux-claude.sh
discover_session() {
  local state_dir
  state_dir=$(find /tmp -maxdepth 1 -name 'party-*' -type d 2>/dev/null | head -1)
  if [[ -z "$state_dir" ]]; then
    echo "Error: No active party session found" >&2
    return 1
  fi
  SESSION_NAME=$(cat "$state_dir/session-name")
  STATE_DIR="$state_dir"
}
```

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] `session/party.sh` — session launcher with iTerm2 detection
- [ ] iTerm2 control mode (`tmux -CC`) integration tested
- [ ] `--raw` fallback for non-iTerm terminals
- [ ] Clean teardown on SIGTERM/SIGINT
- [ ] `$STATE_DIR/messages/to-codex/` and `$STATE_DIR/messages/to-claude/` directories created on startup

---

## Phase 2: Claude → Codex Communication

### 2.1 `tmux-codex.sh` — Claude's interface to Codex

This single script replaces both `call_codex.sh` and `codex-verdict.sh`. Claude calls it via its Bash tool. The script uses `tmux send-keys` to communicate with Codex's pane and file-based handoff for structured data.

**Key principle: Claude keeps full context.** Claude knows why it's requesting a review, what the previous findings were, and what it expects. It sends the request directly and reads the response directly. No middleman losing context.

**Modes:**

| Mode | Replaces | What it does |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `--review` | `call_codex.sh --review` | Generates diff, writes review prompt to file, sends Codex a short message via tmux to read it. Codex notifies Claude when done via `tmux-claude.sh` |
| `--prompt` | `call_codex.sh --prompt` | Writes prompt to file, sends Codex a short message via tmux to read it. Codex notifies Claude when done via `tmux-claude.sh` |
| `--approve` | `codex-verdict.sh approve` | Creates evidence markers (codex-ran + codex-approved). Returns immediately |
| `--re-review` | `codex-verdict.sh request_changes` | Creates codex-ran marker only. Returns immediately |
| `--needs-discussion` | `codex-verdict.sh needs_discussion` | Logs to trace. Returns immediately |

**Implementation:**

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# tmux-codex.sh — Claude's direct interface to Codex via tmux
# Replaces call_codex.sh + codex-verdict.sh
set -euo pipefail

MODE="${1:?Usage: tmux-codex.sh --review|--prompt|--approve|--re-review|--needs-discussion}"

# Discover active party session
STATE_DIR=$(find /tmp -maxdepth 1 -name 'party-*' -type d 2>/dev/null | head -1)
if [[ -z "$STATE_DIR" ]]; then
  echo "Error: No active party session found" >&2
  exit 1
fi
SESSION_NAME=$(cat "$STATE_DIR/session-name")
CODEX_PANE="$SESSION_NAME:work.1"
TIMESTAMP="$(date +%s%N)"

case "$MODE" in

  --review)
    BASE="${2:-main}"
    TITLE="${3:-Code review}"
    FINDINGS_FILE="$STATE_DIR/codex-findings-$TIMESTAMP.json"

    # Just tell Codex what to review. Codex's tmux-review skill defines
    # the review protocol: severity classification, output format, notification.
    tmux send-keys -t "$CODEX_PANE" \
      "Review the changes on this branch against $BASE. Title: $TITLE. Write findings to: $FINDINGS_FILE" C-m

    echo "CODEX_REVIEW_REQUESTED"
    echo "Findings will be written to: $FINDINGS_FILE"
    echo "Claude is NOT blocked. Codex will notify Claude via tmux when review is complete."
    echo "CODEX_REVIEW_RAN"
    ;;

  --prompt)
    PROMPT_TEXT="${2:?Missing prompt text}"
    RESPONSE_FILE="$STATE_DIR/codex-response-$TIMESTAMP.md"

    # Just send the prompt. Codex's skills define how to handle it.
    tmux send-keys -t "$CODEX_PANE" \
      "$PROMPT_TEXT — Write response to: $RESPONSE_FILE" C-m

    echo "CODEX_TASK_REQUESTED"
    echo "Response will be written to: $RESPONSE_FILE"
    echo "Codex will notify Claude via tmux when task is complete."
    ;;

  --approve)
    echo "CODEX APPROVED"
    ;;

  --re-review)
    REASON="${2:-Blocking findings fixed}"
    echo "CODEX REQUEST_CHANGES — $REASON"
    ;;

  --needs-discussion)
    REASON="${2:-Multiple valid approaches or unresolvable findings}"
    echo "CODEX NEEDS_DISCUSSION — $REASON"
    ;;

  *)
    echo "Error: Unknown mode '$MODE'" >&2
    echo "Usage: tmux-codex.sh --review|--prompt|--approve|--re-review|--needs-discussion" >&2
    exit 1
    ;;
esac
```

**How Claude uses this — the review flow:**

```
1. Claude implements code (same as today)
2. Claude runs sub-agent critics via Task tool (same as today)
3. Claude calls: tmux-codex.sh --review main "Add user auth"
   → Script generates diff, writes prompt file, sends tmux message to Codex
   → Script returns IMMEDIATELY — Claude is NOT blocked
4. Claude continues non-edit work (documentation, test planning, etc.)
5. Codex completes the review, writes findings to file, then notifies Claude
   via tmux-claude.sh → Claude sees "[CODEX] Review complete. Findings at: ..."
6. Claude reads the findings file with its Read tool
7. Claude triages each finding (blocking / non-blocking / out-of-scope)
8. Claude maintains issue ledger (same as current system — in Claude's context)
9. Claude decides:
   a. All non-blocking → calls tmux-codex.sh --approve
   b. Blocking issues → fixes them, re-runs critics, calls tmux-codex.sh --re-review
   c. Unresolvable → calls tmux-codex.sh --needs-discussion
```

**No polling needed.** Codex pushes a notification to Claude's pane when done. Claude reacts to incoming messages — same pattern in both directions.

**What Claude retains that a coordinator would lose:**
- Why it made the changes (full implementation context)
- Previous Codex findings and how it triaged them (issue ledger)
- Which findings it already fixed vs. rejected
- The re-review tier decision (targeted swap vs. logic change vs. full cascade)

**Mapping to current system:**

| Current | Tmux equivalent |
|---------|----------------|
| `call_codex.sh --review --base main --title "..."` | `tmux-codex.sh --review main "..."` |
| `call_codex.sh --prompt "..."` | `tmux-codex.sh --prompt "..."` |
| `codex-verdict.sh approve` | `tmux-codex.sh --approve` |
| `codex-verdict.sh request_changes` | `tmux-codex.sh --re-review "reason"` |
| `codex-verdict.sh needs_discussion` | `tmux-codex.sh --needs-discussion "reason"` |

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] `claude/skills/codex-cli/scripts/tmux-codex.sh` — all modes
- [ ] File-based handoff: review prompt written to file, Codex reads it and runs its own git diff
- [ ] Non-blocking `--review` and `--prompt` (return immediately, Codex notifies Claude when done)
- [ ] Review prompt instructs Codex to call `tmux-claude.sh` to notify Claude on completion
- [ ] `--approve`, `--re-review`, `--needs-discussion` for verdict (same sentinels as current system for hook compatibility)

---

## Phase 3: Codex → Claude Communication

### 3.1 `tmux-claude.sh` — Codex's interface to Claude

The mirror image of `tmux-codex.sh`. Codex calls this to ask Claude questions during planning or to request Claude's help investigating the codebase.

**Key principle: Codex keeps full context too.** When Codex is mid-plan and needs info from Claude, it sends the question directly, gets the answer back, and continues with full awareness of its planning context.

**Implementation:**

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# tmux-claude.sh — Codex's direct interface to Claude via tmux
# Replaces call_claude.sh
set -euo pipefail

MESSAGE="${1:?Usage: tmux-claude.sh \"message for Claude\"}"

# Discover active party session
STATE_DIR=$(find /tmp -maxdepth 1 -name 'party-*' -type d 2>/dev/null | head -1)
if [[ -z "$STATE_DIR" ]]; then
  echo "Error: No active party session found" >&2
  exit 1
fi
SESSION_NAME=$(cat "$STATE_DIR/session-name")
CLAUDE_PANE="$SESSION_NAME:work.0"

# Just send the [CODEX] prefixed message to Claude's pane.
# Codex's claude-cli skill defines what messages to send and when.
# Claude's tmux-handler skill defines how to respond.
tmux send-keys -t "$CLAUDE_PANE" "[CODEX] $MESSAGE" C-m

echo "CLAUDE_MESSAGE_SENT"
```

**How Codex uses this — the planning dialogue flow:**

```
1. User sends planning task to Codex pane directly
2. Codex works on the plan...
3. Codex needs to know how the database connection pool works
4. Codex follows its claude-cli skill: creates a response file path, calls:
   tmux-claude.sh "Question: How does the DB connection pool work in src/db/? Write response to: <response_file>"
   → Script sends [CODEX] prefixed message to Claude's pane, returns immediately
5. Claude's tmux-handler skill fires: sees "[CODEX] Question..."
6. Claude investigates the codebase, writes answer to the response file
7. Claude notifies Codex via tmux-codex.sh --prompt "Response ready at: <response_file>"
8. Codex reads the response file, incorporates the answer, continues planning
```

**Multi-turn dialogue:** Multiple exchanges work naturally. Each call creates unique timestamped files. Both agents retain their full context across exchanges because they're persistent tmux sessions.

**Key design: skills define protocol, scripts are just transport.**

- Codex's `claude-cli` skill tells Codex *when* and *how* to contact Claude (message formats, file conventions)
- Claude's `tmux-handler` skill tells Claude *how* to handle incoming `[CODEX]` messages (triage, investigate, respond)
- `tmux-claude.sh` just sends `[CODEX] $MESSAGE` to Claude's pane — no protocol knowledge in the script

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] `codex/skills/claude-cli/scripts/tmux-claude.sh` — thin transport: sends `[CODEX]` prefixed message to Claude's pane
- [ ] Non-blocking (returns immediately, other agent notifies via tmux when done)

---

## Phase 4: Agent Skills for tmux

The scripts (`tmux-codex.sh`, `tmux-claude.sh`) are just thin transport — they send a short message via tmux. The actual behavior (how to review, what format to use, how to notify) lives in skills on each agent's side. This mirrors the current system where `codex exec review` works because Codex has built-in review logic, not because the calling script tells it every detail.

### 4.1 Codex: `tmux-review` Skill

Defines how Codex handles review requests received via tmux. This is the tmux equivalent of `codex exec review`'s built-in behavior.

**`codex/skills/tmux-review/SKILL.md`:**

```markdown
# tmux-review — Handle review requests from Claude via tmux

## Trigger

You receive a message in your tmux pane asking you to review changes against a base branch.

## Protocol

1. **Get the diff**: Run `git diff $(git merge-base HEAD <base>)..HEAD` to see the changes
2. **Review scope**: Review changed files AND adjacent files (callers, callees, types, tests)
   for: correctness bugs, crash paths, security issues, wrong output, architectural concerns
3. **Classify each finding**:
   - **blocking**: correctness bug, crash path, wrong output, security HIGH/CRITICAL
   - **non-blocking**: style nit, "could be simpler", defensive edge case, consistency preference
4. **Write findings** to the file path specified in the message, using this JSON format:
   ```json
   {
     "findings": [
       {
         "id": "F1",
         "file": "path/to/file.ts",
         "line": 42,
         "severity": "blocking",
         "category": "correctness|security|architecture|style|performance",
         "description": "Clear description of the issue",
         "suggestion": "How to fix it"
       }
     ],
     "summary": "One paragraph summary of the review",
     "stats": { "blocking_count": 0, "non_blocking_count": 0, "files_reviewed": 0 }
   }
   ```
5. **Do NOT include a "verdict" field.** You produce findings — the verdict is Claude's decision.
6. **Notify Claude** when done:
   ```bash
   ~/.codex/skills/claude-cli/scripts/tmux-claude.sh "Review complete. Findings at: <findings_file>"
   ```

## On re-review

If you've reviewed this branch before in this session, focus on:
- Verifying previous blocking issues were addressed
- Flagging only genuinely NEW issues
- Do NOT re-raise findings that were already addressed
```

### 4.2 Codex: `claude-cli` Skill (rewritten)

Defines when and how Codex contacts Claude via tmux. This replaces the old `claude-cli/SKILL.md` that used `call_claude.sh`.

**`codex/skills/claude-cli/SKILL.md`:**

```markdown
# claude-cli — Communicate with Claude via tmux

## When to contact Claude

- **During review**: After writing findings to the file, notify Claude that review is complete
- **During planning**: When you need codebase context that would require extensive exploration
  (e.g., "how does the auth middleware chain work?", "what calls this function?")
- **During tasks**: When you need Claude to investigate something in parallel

## How to contact Claude

Use the transport script:
```bash
~/.codex/skills/claude-cli/scripts/tmux-claude.sh "<message>"
```

This sends a `[CODEX]` prefixed message to Claude's tmux pane. The script returns immediately — you are NOT blocked.

## Message conventions

### Notify review complete
After writing findings to the specified file:
```bash
~/.codex/skills/claude-cli/scripts/tmux-claude.sh "Review complete. Findings at: <findings_file>"
```

### Ask a question
When you need information from Claude:
```bash
~/.codex/skills/claude-cli/scripts/tmux-claude.sh "Question: <your question>. Write response to: <response_file>"
```
Create the response file path using: `$STATE_DIR/messages/to-codex/response-$(date +%s%N).md`

### Report task completion
After completing a delegated task:
```bash
~/.codex/skills/claude-cli/scripts/tmux-claude.sh "Task complete. Response at: <response_file>"
```

## Handling Claude's responses

When you see a message in your pane from Claude (e.g., "Response ready at: <path>"):
1. Read the response file
2. Incorporate the answer into your current work
3. Continue — you have full context of what you were doing before asking

## Important

- Each exchange creates unique timestamped files — multi-turn dialogue works naturally
- You retain your full context across exchanges (persistent tmux session)
- Keep questions specific and actionable — Claude will investigate the codebase for you
- Do NOT ask Claude to make code changes. You make changes, Claude reviews.
```

### 4.3 Claude: `tmux-handler` Skill

Defines how Claude handles incoming messages from Codex's tmux pane.

**`claude/skills/tmux-handler/SKILL.md`:**

```markdown
# tmux-handler — Handle incoming messages from Codex via tmux

## Trigger

You see a message in your pane prefixed with `[CODEX]`. These are from Codex's tmux pane.

## Message types

### Review complete
Message: `[CODEX] Review complete. Findings at: <path>`

1. Read the FULL findings file with your Read tool
2. Triage each finding: blocking / non-blocking / out-of-scope
3. Update your issue ledger (reject re-raised closed findings, detect oscillation)
4. Decide verdict:
   - All non-blocking → `tmux-codex.sh --approve`
   - Blocking findings → fix them, choose re-review tier, then `tmux-codex.sh --re-review`
   - Unresolvable → `tmux-codex.sh --needs-discussion "reason"`

### Question from Codex
Message: `[CODEX] Question waiting. Read: <question_file> — Write response to: <response_file>`

1. Read the question file
2. Investigate the codebase to answer the question
3. Write your response to the specified response file
4. Notify Codex: `tmux-codex.sh --prompt "Response ready at: <response_file>"`

### Task complete
Message: `[CODEX] Task complete. Response at: <path>`

1. Read the response file
2. Continue your workflow with the information Codex provided
```

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] `codex/skills/tmux-review/SKILL.md` — Codex's review protocol (severity, format, notification, re-review behavior)
- [ ] `codex/skills/claude-cli/SKILL.md` — Codex's outbound protocol (when/how to contact Claude, message conventions)
- [ ] `claude/skills/tmux-handler/SKILL.md` — Claude's handler for `[CODEX]` messages (triage, verdict, question answering)

---

## Phase 5: Hook Updates

### 5.1 Updated `codex-gate.sh`

Same logic as today, but regex matches `tmux-codex.sh` instead of `call_codex.sh`:

```bash
# Only gate tmux-codex.sh invocations
echo "$COMMAND" | grep -qE '(^|[;&|] *)([^ ]*/)?tmux-codex\.sh' || { echo '{}'; exit 0; }

# Gate 1: --review requires critic APPROVE markers
if echo "$COMMAND" | grep -qE 'tmux-codex\.sh +--review'; then
  # ... same marker checks as today ...
fi

# Gate 2: --approve requires codex-ran marker
if echo "$COMMAND" | grep -qE 'tmux-codex\.sh +--approve'; then
  # ... same codex-ran check as today ...
fi
```

### 5.2 Updated `codex-trace.sh`

Same logic as today, but detects `tmux-codex.sh` output sentinels instead of `call_codex.sh`:

```bash
# Detect tmux-codex.sh invocations
echo "$command" | grep -qE '(^|[;&|] *)([^ ]*/)?tmux-codex\.sh' || exit 0

# Same sentinel detection as today:
# CODEX_REVIEW_RAN → create codex-ran marker
# CODEX APPROVED → create codex-approved marker
# CODEX REQUEST_CHANGES → create codex-ran marker only
# CODEX NEEDS_DISCUSSION → log only
```

The sentinel strings in `tmux-codex.sh` are identical to the current `call_codex.sh` / `codex-verdict.sh` output, so `codex-trace.sh` only needs the regex update. Evidence markers are created by the same hook, triggered by the same sentinels. The dual-layer defense (codex-ran + codex-approved) is preserved.

### 5.3 All other hooks — unchanged

These hooks work identically because they don't reference Codex invocation scripts:

- `agent-trace.sh` — sub-agents still use Task tool
- `marker-invalidate.sh` — still fires on Edit/Write
- `skill-marker.sh` — still creates skill markers
- `pr-gate.sh` — still checks the same `/tmp/claude-*` marker files
- `worktree-guard.sh` — still checks worktree state
- `session-cleanup.sh` — still cleans up on session end
- `skill-eval.sh` — still evaluates skill triggers

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] `claude/hooks/codex-gate.sh` — updated regex only
- [ ] `claude/hooks/codex-trace.sh` — updated regex only
- [ ] All other hooks copied unchanged

---

## Phase 6: Documentation Updates

### 6.1 Updated Workflow Skills

**`task-workflow/SKILL.md` — Steps 7 and 8 change:**

Current step 7:
```
7. **codex** — Invoke `~/.claude/skills/codex-cli/scripts/call_codex.sh` for combined code + architecture review
```

New step 7:
```
7. **codex** — Request codex review via tmux:
   ```bash
   ~/.claude/skills/codex-cli/scripts/tmux-codex.sh --review main "{PR title}"
   ```
   This sends the review to Codex's tmux pane. You are NOT blocked — continue with
   non-edit work while Codex reviews. Codex will notify you via tmux when findings are ready.
```

Current step 8:
```
8. **Handle codex verdict** — Triage findings (see Finding Triage). Classify fix impact for tiered re-review. Signal verdict via `codex-verdict.sh`.
```

New step 8:
```
8. **Triage codex findings** — When the findings file appears:
   a. Read the FULL findings file (not just the summary)
   b. Triage each finding: blocking / non-blocking / out-of-scope
   c. Update issue ledger (reject re-raised closed findings, detect oscillation)
   d. If no blocking findings:
      ```bash
      ~/.claude/skills/codex-cli/scripts/tmux-codex.sh --approve
      ```
   e. If blocking findings need fixes: fix them, choose re-review tier:
      - Targeted swap (typo): run test-runner only → if pass, `tmux-codex.sh --approve`
      - Logic change: re-run critics → if approve, `tmux-codex.sh --re-review`
      - New export/signature: full cascade → `tmux-codex.sh --re-review`
   f. If unresolvable (max 3 iterations):
      ```bash
      ~/.claude/skills/codex-cli/scripts/tmux-codex.sh --needs-discussion "reason"
      ```
```

**`bugfix-workflow/SKILL.md`** — Same pattern: replace `call_codex.sh` with `tmux-codex.sh`, replace `codex-verdict.sh` with `tmux-codex.sh --approve/--re-review/--needs-discussion`.

**`codex-cli/SKILL.md`** — Full rewrite: describe the tmux-based invocation pattern, file-based handoff, push notification (Codex notifies Claude), and all modes. Document that `--review` and `--prompt` are non-blocking.

### 6.2 Updated Rules

**`execution-core.md`:**
- Codex Review Gate section: same logic, `tmux-codex.sh` instead of `call_codex.sh`
- Decision matrix: unchanged logic, updated script names

**`autonomous-flow.md`:**
- Violation patterns: `call_codex.sh` → `tmux-codex.sh`, `codex-verdict.sh` → `tmux-codex.sh --approve`
- Checkpoint markers: same markers, same hooks (just updated regex)

**`CLAUDE.md`:**
- Sub-agents table: replace `call_codex.sh` / `codex-verdict.sh` with `tmux-codex.sh` (all modes)
- Add tmux context section: "You are running in a tmux pane alongside Codex. You can communicate with Codex directly via `tmux-codex.sh`. Codex reviews are non-blocking — you can continue working while Codex reviews."
- Add `[CODEX]` message convention: "Messages prefixed with `[CODEX]` are from Codex's tmux pane. Read the referenced question file, investigate, and write your response to the specified response file."
- Add verdict authority note: same as before (Claude triages, Claude decides)

**`codex/AGENTS.md`:**
- Add tmux context: "You are running as a persistent interactive session in a tmux pane alongside Claude. You can communicate with Claude directly via `tmux-claude.sh`. When asked to write output to a file, always comply — file-based handoff is how agents exchange structured data. You retain context across reviews within this session. IMPORTANT: You produce FINDINGS, not verdicts."

### 6.3 Updated Settings

**`settings.json`:**

```diff
- "Bash(~/.claude/skills/codex-cli/scripts/call_codex.sh:*)",
- "Bash(~/.claude/skills/codex-cli/scripts/codex-verdict.sh:*)",
+ "Bash(~/.claude/skills/codex-cli/scripts/tmux-codex.sh:*)",
```

Hook config: no structural changes needed — `codex-gate.sh` and `codex-trace.sh` keep their names, just updated regex inside.

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Updated `task-workflow/SKILL.md`
- [ ] Updated `bugfix-workflow/SKILL.md`
- [ ] Rewritten `codex-cli/SKILL.md`
- [ ] Updated `execution-core.md`
- [ ] Updated `autonomous-flow.md`
- [ ] Updated `CLAUDE.md`
- [ ] Updated `codex/AGENTS.md`
- [ ] Updated `settings.json`

---

## Phase 7: Testing

### 7.1 Test Infrastructure

Shell-based test harness. Mock agents simulate Claude and Codex behavior.

**`mock-claude.sh`:**
```bash
# Simulates Claude Code responses
# Reads from stdin, pattern-matches, writes expected output
while IFS= read -r line; do
  case "$line" in
    *"[CODEX] Question waiting"*)
      # Extract file paths and respond
      question_file=$(echo "$line" | grep -oP 'Read: \K\S+')
      response_file=$(echo "$line" | grep -oP 'Write response to: \K\S+')
      echo "Mock Claude answering question from $question_file"
      echo "The database uses a pooled connection with max 10 connections." > "$response_file"
      ;;
    *)
      echo "Acknowledged: $line"
      ;;
  esac
done
```

**`mock-codex.sh`:**
```bash
# Simulates Codex responses
# Reads from stdin, writes findings to specified files
REVIEWS_BEFORE_APPROVE="${MOCK_REVIEWS:-3}"
review_count=0

while IFS= read -r line; do
  case "$line" in
    *"review request at"*)
      ((review_count++))
      # Read prompt file to find findings file path
      prompt_file=$(echo "$line" | grep -oP 'at \K\S+')
      findings_file=$(grep 'Write your complete findings to:' "$prompt_file" | grep -oP ': \K\S+')
      if (( review_count >= REVIEWS_BEFORE_APPROVE )); then
        echo '{"findings":[],"summary":"All issues addressed.","stats":{"blocking_count":0,"non_blocking_count":0,"files_reviewed":5}}' > "$findings_file"
      else
        echo '{"findings":[{"id":"F1","file":"src/auth.ts","line":42,"severity":"blocking","category":"correctness","description":"Missing null check","suggestion":"Add null guard"}],"summary":"Found 1 blocking issue.","stats":{"blocking_count":1,"non_blocking_count":0,"files_reviewed":5}}' > "$findings_file"
      fi
      echo "REVIEW_COMPLETE"
      ;;
  esac
done
```

### 7.2 Test Cases

**Session tests (`test-party.sh`):**
- [ ] `party.sh` creates tmux session with 2 panes
- [ ] `party.sh --raw` works without iTerm2
- [ ] `party.sh --stop` cleanly tears down session and state dir
- [ ] State directory has correct subdirectories

**Claude→Codex tests (`test-tmux-codex.sh`):**
- [ ] `--review` generates diff, writes prompt file, sends to Codex pane
- [ ] `--review` returns immediately (non-blocking)
- [ ] `--prompt` writes prompt file, sends to Codex pane
- [ ] `--approve` outputs correct sentinel string
- [ ] `--re-review` outputs correct sentinel string
- [ ] `--needs-discussion` outputs correct sentinel string
- [ ] Script fails gracefully when no party session exists

**Codex→Claude tests (`test-tmux-claude.sh`):**
- [ ] Question file written correctly
- [ ] Message sent to Claude pane
- [ ] Script returns immediately (non-blocking)
- [ ] Script fails gracefully when no party session exists

**Hook tests (`test-hooks.sh`):**
- [ ] `codex-gate.sh` blocks `tmux-codex.sh --review` without critic markers
- [ ] `codex-gate.sh` allows `tmux-codex.sh --review` with critic markers
- [ ] `codex-gate.sh` blocks `tmux-codex.sh --approve` without codex-ran marker
- [ ] `codex-trace.sh` creates codex-ran marker on CODEX_REVIEW_RAN sentinel
- [ ] `codex-trace.sh` creates codex-approved marker on CODEX APPROVED sentinel

**Integration test (`test-integration.sh`):**
- [ ] Full review cycle with mock agents: Claude implements → critics → tmux-codex --review → Codex writes findings → Claude reads → tmux-codex --approve → markers created
- [ ] Multi-review cycle: 3 rounds of findings → fixes → re-review → eventual approve
- [ ] Planning dialogue: Codex asks Claude → Claude responds → Codex reads response
- [ ] Bidirectional: Claude reviews via Codex, then Codex asks Claude a question, both in same session

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] `tests/mock-claude.sh`, `tests/mock-codex.sh`
- [ ] `tests/test-party.sh`
- [ ] `tests/test-tmux-codex.sh`
- [ ] `tests/test-tmux-claude.sh`
- [ ] `tests/test-hooks.sh`
- [ ] `tests/test-integration.sh`
- [ ] `tests/run-tests.sh`

## Phase 8: Installation & Migration

### 8.1 Installer

Adapted from `ai-config/install.sh`. Symlinks the new `claude/` and `codex/` directories:

```bash
# Option A: replace ai-config entirely
./install.sh                    # Creates ~/.claude → ai-config-tmux/claude, ~/.codex → ai-config-tmux/codex

# Option B: install alongside (both systems available)
./install.sh --alongside        # Creates ~/.claude-tmux → ai-config-tmux/claude
                                # User switches by re-symlinking ~/.claude
```

### 8.2 iTerm2 Keybindings

Set up keybindings so launching and managing party sessions is a single keystroke.

**Setup (one-time, via iTerm2 Settings):**

1. **Create a "Party" profile** using iTerm2 dynamic profiles:

```json
{
  "Profiles": [
    {
      "Name": "Party",
      "Guid": "party-session-profile",
      "Custom Command": "Yes",
      "Command": "~/ai-config-tmux/session/party.sh",
      "Working Directory": "",
      "Custom Directory": "Recycle",
      "Tags": ["ai-config", "party"]
    }
  ]
}
```

2. **Add keybindings** (Settings → Keys → Key Bindings → `+`):

| Keybind | Action | Effect |
|---------|--------|--------|
| `Cmd+Shift+P` | New Tab with Profile → Party | Launch a new party session |
| `Cmd+Shift+K` | Send Text: `party.sh --stop\n` | Kill the current party session |

### 8.3 Migration path

```
Week 1:   Build session launcher (Phase 1) + tmux-codex.sh (Phase 2) + tmux-claude.sh (Phase 3)
Week 2:   Update hooks (Phase 4) + documentation (Phase 5)
Week 3:   Testing (Phase 6) + installation (Phase 7)
Week 4:   Integration testing with real agents, side-by-side evaluation
          → Decision: adopt tmux, stay with CLI, or hybrid
```

**Rollback:** `ln -sf ~/ai-config/claude ~/.claude` — instant revert to subprocess model.

---

## Risk Register

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| Codex ignores file-write instruction | Medium | Prompt engineering in review template; fall back to `tmux capture-pane` |
| Large diff exceeds tmux send-keys limit | Low | Not applicable: Codex runs its own git diff in the shared repo |
| `[CODEX]` message confused with user input | Low | Distinctive prefix; documented in CLAUDE.md |
| Agent crashes | Medium | User can see both panes; restart agent manually or re-run `party.sh` |
| Race condition: code edit during Codex review | Medium | `marker-invalidate.sh` still fires on Edit/Write — same as today |
| Codex `--sandbox read-only` can't write to `/tmp/` | High | Test this first; if blocked, use `workspace-write` or capture pane output |
| Claude rubber-stamps --approve without reading findings | Medium | Same risk as today; mitigated by `codex-gate.sh` (gate 2: codex-ran required) and SKILL.md instructions |
| Codex forgets to notify Claude after writing findings | Medium | Review prompt explicitly instructs Codex to call `tmux-claude.sh`; Codex's AGENTS.md reinforces this convention |
| Codex takes too long, no notification arrives | Low | User can see both panes in iTerm2 and nudge either agent; could add a timeout convention in skill docs |

---

## Success Criteria

1. **Full review cycle works:** Claude implements → critics → `tmux-codex.sh --review` → Codex writes findings → Claude reads → triages → `tmux-codex.sh --approve` → markers created → PR
2. **Multi-review cycle works:** Multiple rounds with Claude triaging each, maintaining issue ledger, eventual approve — all with persistent Codex context
3. **Claude keeps full context:** No context loss between review iterations (Claude remembers previous findings, its issue ledger, why it made changes)
4. **Codex keeps full context:** Codex remembers previous reviews within the session (can focus on "was this fixed?" rather than re-reviewing from scratch)
5. **Planning dialogue works:** Codex asks Claude via `tmux-claude.sh`, Claude responds, Codex continues — both retain context
6. **Bidirectional:** Claude→Codex (reviews, tasks) and Codex→Claude (questions) both work
7. **Non-blocking:** Claude can work while Codex reviews; Codex can work while Claude answers
8. **All existing hooks still work:** agent-trace, marker-invalidate, skill-marker, pr-gate, worktree-guard, session-cleanup, skill-eval
9. **Markers are compatible:** Same `/tmp/claude-*` paths, same semantics, `pr-gate.sh` works unchanged
10. **iTerm2 UX:** `tmux -CC` gives native panes with scrollback and search
11. **Tests pass:** All test suites green
12. **Rollback works:** Single symlink change reverts to subprocess model

## Appendix B: Dependencies

| Dependency | Required | Install | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|---------|---------|
| `tmux` | Yes | `brew install tmux` | Terminal multiplexer — core infrastructure |
| `jq` | Yes | `brew install jq` | JSON parsing for hook input |
| `claude` | Yes | `curl -fsSL https://cli.anthropic.com/install.sh \| sh` | Claude Code CLI |
| `codex` | Yes | `brew install --cask codex` | Codex CLI |
| iTerm2 | Recommended | `brew install --cask iterm2` | Terminal with native tmux integration. Raw tmux works without it |

Note: `fswatch` is no longer needed — there's no coordinator daemon watching for signal files. Claude and Codex poll for response files directly.
